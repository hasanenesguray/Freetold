The property\'s furnishings & facilities are great and we have very rarely experienced any issues with them. Those that have come up have always been fixed or dealt with swiftly. For example, the shower door came loose and a contractor was sent to review and replace it within the space of a week. Communication has always been clear and helpful, for example if window cleaners are present on certain days. The landlord has also been accommodating of our requests, for example with placing some furniture in an on-site storage locker - and has personally helped us with this process. Overall, the property has been excellent and couldn\'t really wish for a better landlord - this has been the most hassle free tenancy I\'ve experienced.",08-08-2022 02:39 PM,

Among the rubbish was a used condom which would seem rather comedic had this not been the place I would be living in. The mattresses in the property where very dirty, one of the beds was partially broken causing the dirty mattress to slope down in the middle and the one of the headboards had the leather partially torn off. The light bulbs provided did not work and when the same light bulbs where put back in prior to us moving out, Landlord used this as an excuse to deduct from our deposit.

There where mould problems which the landlord,  would not remedy bar telling us to wipe it down with bleach. We were told the kitchen ceiling was to be painted soon after we moved in, however this didn\&#39;t happen for the entire length of out tenancy. We where unable to use the shower due to it leaking through to the kitchen via the ceiling. The washing machines provided broke down several times and where replaced with similarly faulty ones. The lock to the stairs would get jammed preventing access to the property and needed to be removed by a neighbor. The same lock was broken for most of the tenancy.

There often where drug users that would hang out in the stairs leading up to the property who would leave sterile water containers used to prepare drugs for injection laying around on the stairs along with other rubbish. Along side this, the people from the hostel next door along with some neighbors would harass you as you\&#39;re coming home.

Firstly he overcharges for the property (like most landlords) but what is cheeky about this landlord is the property not only is a basement with hardly any light, it also comes with problems such as damp, mould & leaking. For a whole 6 months I had to sleep in a bedroom with black mould covering the wall as the landlord took ages to do something about it. What was funny was when we started investigating the room, we could see he had simply painted over other areas where the black mould appeared. He likes to solve his problems with a plaster - minimum costs. What’s worse is when we complain he begins to complain back at us stating we are difficult tenants. However, our complaints were fair, professional and polite. He clearly just didn’t like a group of tenants actually making the effort to try and create change. He actually made my girlfriend feel distressed when interacting with him. At the end of our tenancy he tried to get us to pay for a full professional deep clean (from our own pockets) which costs around £100. However, at the time the new law came in that doesn’t require tenants to do that anymore - so we insisted we would do it ourselves. It took us a lot of arguments to finally get him to back off. He then came to inspect the house after we finished (which was funny because he’d never made the effort to come out to the house when other problems were happening). We had cleaned the house spotless so he had nothing to complain about. I do not recommend this house. It’s not worth it.

It is managed by a letting agency (currently Edward Taub) and the owner does not wish to deal with tenants directly. It is well maintained overall, but in need of TLC and some upgrades. The selling points: it is light thanks to 4 windows. Downsides: drafts, noisy neighbours, difficulty in keeping it warm, yearly rent increases. 
The flooring is nice in the corridor and living room, where you find a light wood laminate flooring, and also in the kitchen area, with dark tiles. Where it needs fixing: cracked tiles in the lavatory and extremely consumed carpet in the bedroom. The flat has a C EPC rating on paper but while it does have double glazing, window frames are old and there are drafts from around every window (and from underneath the bath tub!). The flat has two storage heaters (living room and corridor) and one regular heater in the bedroom. Due to the inefficiency of storage heating, the flat results tricky to keep warm (and even more difficult is to replace air during the day, because you\'d lose all heath). The landlord complained that all tenants find them difficult to operate, which is why a third storage heater in the bedroom was replaced with a normal heater. The storage heater in the corridor is positioned directly underneath the opening to the rooftop, which is separated by a flimsy piece of wood (read: the heat goes straight up and is dispersed too easily). Two light fixtures (living room and bedroom) leave holes in the ceiling exposed. The bedroom is a very small double (I could not add a headboard to the bed because it wouldn\'t leave enough room to walk around the bed) with very consumed brown carpet which is clean, but should be replaced as time has clearly eaten it away. A built-in closet completes the room, but a regular closet would have been much better (the closet is awkwardly organized) and could have sliding doors to maximize space) and a big rod with brown curtains. 
The bathroom is functional with tub and electric shower and a very old down flow electric heater that looks like something from the 80s (read: never tested due to safety concerns). There are no windows in the bathroom , only a noisy fan connected to the light switch. The living room/kitchen area is nice and the three windows give it plenty of light. The sun hits the window only in the early morning, so it does not help to warm up the rooms. The kitchen has generous cabinet space and has an open plan, with an island against the wall (but not enough counter to use stools). The small fridge unit was replaced at the beginning of the tenancy because the previous tenant had broken the door of the freezer unit. No dishwasher. The washer is a Hotpoint Aquarius WD420 and unfortunately only works with pre-set programs (can\'t select water temperature and speed of spin cycle). The electric hobs are also need tlc: there are no marks whatsoever, so it is hard to figure which way to turn the knobs and some of the indicators telling which hob you\'re using also don\'t work  (all brought up to the attention of letting agency/owner at the beginning of tenancy but owner preferred not to replace it). There is an oven (never used, so can\'t comment on it) and an extractor fan.
Neighbours are on the noisy side: nexdoor is a crying baby and a child who loves to scream, including at odd hours (1 am!!!) and downstairs neighbours like to play loud music in the afternoons. Had to call police 3 times in the first year for outside disturbances from the building directly in front of 7 Thurlow. No problems the following year, but expect kids playing football against the walls of the building and smoke seeping through doors and windows even though it is banned. Complained about smell of weed (on a daily basis), but nothing ever done. New storage bin area installed and fenced area for laundry were added after the first year: very nice additions. Some tenants/guests have problems understanding how the magnetic door to the building works (must push a button and then push the door), so it was damaged twice in two years, possibly another reason for the yearly rent increases. 
All and all a good temporary accommodation. The letting agency is always willing to help.",11-11-2018 03:42 PM,£900

We only lived here for 12 months as we all split up which was a shame as we had one more year at university I would rate the property a 9/10 and the landlord Mr Rakesh patel a 9/10 he promised what he said we even messaged him once at 2am in the morning and he replied back then as one of us got stuck in the bathroom

The electrician who installed the lights installed them so the wiring was being burned through, but after a photographing the issue the landlord got an electrician around to replace it. 

The lock managed to latch while I was outside, requiring a locksmith, but I believe the locksmith concluded it was an issue with the lock used, and replaced it same day.

The RCD will sometimes trip when running the washing machine. This has been brought up with the landlord multiple times, but as a source can\'t be identified, this is still an ongoing issue. Though less frequent since turning off the immersion heater. The only time it has tripped has been when the washing machine has been running for what it\'s worth.

The kitchen is in the centre of the property, so gets no direct natural light. Only through a small window that\'s connected to the hallway opposite the door to the property, with an equally small window going to the stairwell. Or from the corridor/connecting room itself. Generally you\'re going to need the light on return using the kitchen.

The location is decently close to things - only about a fifteen minute walk to the centre of town, or to east Croydon station. The road itself can get quite busy and usually has some traffic.

When we moved out, we were given a bill for double the deposit held: essentially the landlord had redecorated the house completely and was trying to charge us for it (to a total of more than £3,600). We had to take him to court as he refused to follow the legal guidelines for what is expected for deposit use, and after a year and three months of legal proceedings he agreed to a deal where we paid the £200 pound original deposit offer we had suggested when we moved out, and he returned the rest of the deposit. I would watch out with this property as the landlord is likely to try the same trick of massively inflated deposit requests with any future tenant. His requests were completely baseless, for example trying to charge 250 quid for a bed frame I found online for 50 pounds.

The area is very convenient for a couple with children.  Re locating from the city ( London ) we have been conquered by the conservatory that makes one additional room during the summer ( extremely convenient to dry clothes as the washing machine does not offer the dryer option ).  Unfortunately during the winter ( from November to April ) this additional room can not be used ( to cold and wet to dry clothes ) and unless considering using a heater in the room ( at a cost! ) it won\'t be possible to use that room other than during the daylight.  Except for the conservatory, the hall, the kitchen and the bathroom, all the surface of the house is cover by carpet what is not the most convenient to clean ( particularly with children ).  From our opinion, the mistake is to have installed carpet on the living room were it would have been much more advisable to install laminated floor.  The main issue with that property is the agency managing the property, Simon and Miller in Larkfield ( Maidstone ).  We have a couple of years experience in renting properties but this agency is from far the poorest agency we never had to deal with.  Up to now, they charged us ( the cost have been added to our online account and i assume they are expecting to deduct the costs from our deposit by the end of the tenancy ) for 3 allegedly non necessary requests of assistance charged £72, £40 and £48.  We tried to discuss the issue but we have always been shut down and told we will have to pay.  The attitude of the agency is disdainful and patronizing and is the real hassle of renting this property.  Regarding the repairs, the agency is unable to solve urgent problem efficiently:  when we moved in the property, the sink plug was stuck half closed and it took the agency/ the landlord 9 months to replace it.  We had issue with the lock of the doors between the conservatory and the living room that was not closing and told it won\'t be changed.  We had issue with the front door lock.  We had issue with the oven ( it has just been replaced 3 months after we reported the fault ).  Another important mistake regarding the energy consumption: the thermostat is located in the hall where the ( open ) stairway is located.  Without a permanent manual adjustment, the heating is always working: it\'s too hot upstairs and barely warm downstairs.

The landlady was extremely unco-operative and all throughout I found her attitude very unpleasant. The flat was practically uninhabitable with 2 window locks of bedrooms broken and not being able to shut the windows at all. In addition the balcony door handle was broken and the door would not shut properly letting in winds. The showers of both baths were not working. Ensuite shower had a temperature regulation problem and the other had a broken shower. Overall the condition was pretty unpleasant with chipped doors, cupboards, mouldy washing machine, dirty commode and the flat was handed to me unclean. The window used to let in winds and I suffered greatly because of that. Initially she did not agree to do any repairs but after the agent intervened she did fix one shower that was broken, and the window locks were changed in Mid December after 4 months. The balcony door she refused to fix and even acknowledge it to be a problem. The door would not seal cold air and I fell ill with pneumonia for the second time very badly. After this I asked the Foxtons to convey the message to the landlady that either she fixed the door or she lets me break the contract earlier, as the contract didn\'t have a break clause. If I have to stay in that flat in that condition I would complaint to the council. The agent got back to me saying that the lady had agreed to that I could terminate the contract earlier. However upon vacating she had claimed falsely and unjustly about damages that was already there in the first place and for leaving the property unclean. I felt this to be very unfair and dishonest on her part to act like this. Overall I found the flat to be completely unpleasant to live in because of the hostile attitude of the landlady and her issues with repairs and was overpriced. I would rate the property 1 star ⭐ and landlady rating is not even applicable.",21-03-2021 06:06 PM,£1400

It has been extended and modernised and has space and light in the extended portion but is very cramped upstairs and in the shower room downstairs. The shower room is directly opposite the front door and was full of dirt when I moved in. The bathroom upstairs is very low and also small and had leaks due to poor plumbing.

The location has fantastic scenery, and the towns in the area a joy to visit. You need a car to live here, but two spaces on a new driveway are provided. However, the cottage was very difficult to find due to the lack of a sign at the entrance. It took me eight months to condense the directions into 200 characters to allow delivery drivers to locate the property. It is close to Bristol, but the roads become packed at peak hours. However, this is similar to many other cities. There are always multiple routes into Bristol if there is an accident, and the property is well situated for access to the M4/M5 for longer commutes.

Unfortunately, the road beside the cottage is used by HGV lorries and commuters as a shortcut to avoid a busy junction on the M5. There are also four quarries in the local area, and the road is used 3-4 nights a week for overnight quarry lorry convoys which pass every 20 minutes or so. Being an old building, it had no foundations which meant the convoys were so loud and caused such vibrations that a picture of my children fell off the wall and was severely damaged. The downstairs windows are double glazed, as are the Velux windows in the upstairs bathroom and hall but the bedroom windows are very old and single paned due to health and safety fire rules.

Although the property seemed clean inside, when I looked closer after moving in, it was filthy behind the cooker, the shower required days of work to even get it to a point where I could use it.

The heating is oil based, and your bills will fluctuate with oil prices, it also more work monitoring oil levels and ordering deliveries. The property was tough to keep at a constant temperature due to incorrect radiator sizing and lack of central room thermostat. Despite offering to have one installed by my brother for free, the landlord and landlady prevaricated and would not accept that the cottage needed one. My brother is a 25-year heating and airconditioning technical expert who runs his own company, and the local heating engineer even mentioned that he could not understand why they did not install central thermostats in the cottage or the main house and then complained that the heating was expensive and that breakdowns were regular. A central thermostat would have mitigated both of these problems.

There is a tiny garden with astroturf, but it is very private with a large stone wall around it.

The lighting is mostly spotlights, banks of 4 in each bedroom upstairs. Personally, I think the lighting design is not good. Too bright and direct but that is a subjective opinion. I replaced many halogen bulbs with LED equivalents out of my pocket due to the cost and heat generated having them on. 

The landlord and landlady, while being pleasant, were both working full time. Thereofre, any request for minor repairs was not attended to or repaired poorly by themselves or me. They did not want to spend the money on professional workmen for interior maintenance. Their amateur attitude was also a factor in the cleanliness of the property was not subject to deep cleaning for many years over many tenancies. 

As I expected the owners tried to take a good portion of the deposit from me, that was due to damage caused by issues I had verbally pointed out but were not resolved. I won the Deposit Protection Scheme arbitration that I entered due to problems with the contract and their lack of reactivity when I mentioned issues. I recommend you very carefully check everything on their manual list of the state of the interior.In addition, take photo\'s of every room, every item, in every cupboard and behind every appliance if you decide to move in. When raising issues, make sure they are via email or in writing and keep them for future proof.

The privacy is severely lacking due to the main house right next to you. I noticed I was being watched but ignored it until multiple visitors mentioned it to me. I suggest you get net curtains, which of course darkens the property as the sun shines through the windows on the side of the cottage where the main building is located.

My overall experience was generally very poor, and caused me incredible extra stress that I did not need at that time.",22-10-2018 02:56 AM,£840

To our knowledge, the landlord is not planning to make any changes or refurbishments to these items. 

Our letter:

\""We’ve noticed the following issues in the unit that have arisen from normal wear and tear or defects in furnishings, which you might want to consider before re-letting:

- The damp in the corner of the bedroom (refer to earlier communication) still appears to be soaking through the walls. Perhaps this is still damp from the earlier leak. Regardless, real issue is that mould is still growing inside the walls. It is still possible to smell the mould and damp. (My wife was diagnosed with adult-onset asthma only after this damp appeared, and her ongoing breathing difficulties appear to be triggered by the black mould in the bedroom). The mouldy wall is a health and safety concern.

-The carpet in the unit is very worn, especially around doorsills. It is fraying at many places where the carpet meets the walls, and where the carpet meets the doors, in multiple rooms. There was a duct-taped section keeping the carpet together when we first moved to the property, and now we have added several duct-tape additions of our own in places where opening doors pull at the carpet. This has been necessary to keep the carpet from getting caught under doors and fraying further.

-Many other interior doors do not close properly, particularly the door to the bedroom with the round wall and the lounge with the fireplace.

- The tray containing the electric hobs in the kitchen, which once fell out of position (refer to our earlier communication about this problem), has been imperfectly reinstalled and sits somewhat lower than it should. This creates a problem where the heating elements do not sit flush with the glass, making the heat uneven and cooking more difficult.

- The boiler spontaneously shuts off from time to time, frequently requiring the relight button to be pressed. This is particularly an issue when it goes off in the night, leaving the house without heat while we are sleeping. 

- The freezer door latch has broken, making the freezer not close properly and resulting in frost buildup. Normal defrosting does not seem to solve the problem. It is nearly impossible to use the freezer, and the open freezer compartment makes the refrigerator section too cold. 

- The washing machine sometimes apparently does not receive sufficient water, causing the wash cycle to frequently stop with a “tap closed” error. 

- The bathroom sink had a stuck drain which was partially repaired, but we were instructed not to close the drain until further repairs could be made.

- A smell often comes out of the bathroom sink when you use the taps. Your handyman told us at one point that this was normal, but the smell is quite strong and sulfuric, and only comes when you turn on the water. 

- The right knob on the bathroom sink has been gradually reducing the amount of water it will deliver from the tap. Over the last few months it’s gone from letting out about half of what the left knob will deliver, to just a trickle of water. Right now almost no water comes out of the right knob when you turn it.\""

In addition this letter, it should be noted that most of the windows do not shut properly (the flat is part of a historic house, and the windows are original and not double glazed), and insects regularly fly into the flat, since it\'s surrounded by parkland on three sides. We\'ve had particular problems with wasps and spiders.

On the positive side, the landlord is very quick at responding to emails. However, he is very slow to make any necessary updates to the property. In the first instance, he will come personally or send a handyman to see what kind of \""patch\"" can be made. If he can\'t figure out a good quick-fix or patch for the problem, then you should expect a long delay for a fix (for example, two weeks for a new washing machine for us, and he\'s never corrected a problem with the sink).

An example: the old hobs in the very old hob/oven unit (probably last updated in the 1970s)  *collapsed and fell through the oven* earlier this year. Instead of fixing the unit, his handyman patched the hob by rigging it sloppily back up under the glass. Now the hobs don\'t sit straight, so it\'s really difficult to cook (and not all of the cooking options on the hob/oven unit worked in the first place). This is an example of a \""patch\"" job.

Yet another example - and the most critical one - when a damp issue was identified, and black mould was found growing on the walls in the master bedroom, the landlord simply had his handyman come over and slap stain remover and paint on the problem. The water leaked through over and over again, and the mould kept growing. This led to me developing asthma and breathing problems (as noted on the list above). To this date, the landlord seems to have no plan to actually fix the problem, and merely keeps having his handyman come by and hide the mould and damp stains under another coat of paint. It\'s a serious health and safety problem.

Final example - the carpet is ancient. When we moved into the property (as mentioned above), we noticed the carpet was already old, that it was fraying where the doors close, and that there was grey tape keeping some of the carpet in place. Fast forward to now - the carpet is of course worse after another year and eight months of wear and tear. It\'s frayed or pulling back, revealing the plywood underneath, when you close nearly all of the doors. Despite being on its last leg, it\'s clear the landlord wants us to keep the old carpet for his next tenant. When we noted that the carpet was really old and frayed (and frankly disgusting as well), he just sent in a handyman to add more tape to tape the carpet down under the doors - but, hey, it\'s black tape this time! This is especially frustrating in our last days of the tenancy, since obviously the doors still pull at the carpet which is now covered in black tape, and of course the tape is sticky and it catches to the door when we close them. So this tape \""patch\"" has just left us with a sticky mess and even more frayed carpet. I can\'t imagine how he thinks the next tenant will be okay with living with taped-down carpet.

These are just illustrations of how the landlord \""does business.\"" When the paint peels or a crack appears, he sends in a handyman who does a pretty sloppy job. When our rent is 2800 pounds a month, you\'d expect he could move a bit quicker and afford a new washing machine or hob or carpet...

Finally, to add insult to injury, when the estate agent started showing prospective tenants to the flat this week, the tenants were of course turned off by the flat. Our landlord had the nerve to write me this letter, insulting us and presuming that *we* were to blame for the flat not being rented on its first viewing:  
\""please can I ask that you keep the property tidy and presentable for any viewings (as I am sure you will do in any case!) so that I can tie up a re-let ASAP and minimise the need for further viewings which will be to our mutual benefit.\""

I of course responded: \""Our house was impeccably clean when the last visitation took place, and it will be for any further viewings. As we were present during the last viewing, we heard the prospective tenant make comments about the condition of the property, particularly the frayed carpet that Trevor has taped, and noticed that the flat has not been updated recently. We are always committed to keeping and presenting a tidy flat.\""

So, tenants beware: if you rent this property, your landlord will not only refuse to maintain it, but he expects you to pay a luxury rent for a run-down place, and will blame *you* no one wants to rent it after you.

In sum, the landlord runs this property like a cheap hostel but wants to charge a luxury rent. After he raised our rent this year, were left paying an exorbitant rent of 2800 pounds - and we felt stuck there because we had a newborn baby and were desperate not to move. As soon as we got our bearings, we went out and searched the market and found newly refurbished (clean and HEALTHY) properties in as great locations for 800 pounds less a month. We immediately terminated our lease using the break clause as soon as we found a new living situation. 

We\'ve since learned that our landlord expects to fetch a rent of 3500 pounds a month for the place. We find this shocking.",26-10-2016 01:44 PM,£2800

The landlord was elderly and liked talking about the war, but that was no excuse for the disrepair of this property and his refusal and excuses to help.

We spent 26 months in this property and I\'m going to list just some of the issues that still stick out to me now after all this time;
- There was mold throughout the property, mainly in the bathroom, kitchen and small bedroom. To address it an extractor fan was installed in the bathroom. Previously, there was a hole in the wall in preparation of a fan, but no actual fan installed. An extractor was added to the drier in the kitchen. Previously it had just been pumping out all that steam into the kitchen. These 2 amends did not solve the issue. 
- The landlord would enter the property without warning and without us present. I once came home from work to find the property stinking. It turned out he\'d been round to spray mould remover on the walls, but didn\'t then wash it off. 
- The living room window was installed upside down. As a result, you need to get a ladder to climb up and release the lock in order to close it once open. As this is a first floor flat, this is dangerous. His fix for this was to permanently seal it shut using the same sealant you would generally use in the bathroom. 
- The carpets had holes in them, paint splatter on them, and weren\'t tacked down. Where they were tacked down, in doorways for example, they were loose and we would literally cut out feet or rip our socks on them, so you have to wear shoes or slippers at all times. 
- There\'s a rotting mattress in the garden. We were assured it would be removed when we moved in, but it was still there when we moved out. 
- The 2 sheds were overflowing with the previous tenants belongings, including a sofa when we moved in. These were emptied, initially... 
- The attic was also full to the brim. To empty this, he sent round a gardener with a van. The van wasn\'t big enough. So, we helped the man fill the van (this would have been an impossible one man job, as the attic access was just a hatch and he was having to move wardrobes, doors, tables etc). Once the van was full, we then stuffed the overflow into the sheds, and that still only cleared half the attic space, which at least allowed us to store a few bits.
- The landlord was a bully. He would have me in tears when he came round, telling me how difficult I was making his life because I had asked for the mould issue to be resolved. I told him I was getting ill. He would just raise his voice. So we left. 4 months later I had my cancer diagnosis. Mould (as far as I know) doesn\'t cause cancer, but I do believe if I\'d have been forced to remain in that house through chemo, I probably would have died.
- He sent a roofer to look at the living room window, who unsurprisingly wasn\'t able to fix it. He sent a gardener to look at the roof. He sent an electrician to look at the boiler. It was as if he was determined to not fix anything, but to look like he was trying and just \""couldn\'t find the right people\"".
- We were told we could use the drive out front. You can\'t. It belongs to the lady who lives downstairs. Street parking is scares. After a month there I gave up and sold my car. 
- Plug sockets, light switches and the thermostat were painted over. The sockets were literally full of paint, so half of them didn\'t work. One had blown completely. There was evidence of burning and melting and the live wire just left. Other sockets had been illegally installed, as we found out after an inspection, and the illegal fittings were removed, which further halfed our plug capacity in the living room. He never fixed the thermostat. 
- The oven was an electric oven, but used a regular plug socket, which you could literally feel heat up as you used it. This oven did break while we were tenants, which we then replaced with a safe gas cooker. 
- The boiler was condemned and no action was taken.
- At some point in the past the living room had been wall papered. By the time we moved in, the wall paper had been painted over in a garish green. We wondered why. Then realised it was because there were in total 5 fist sized holes in the wall, that had been ductaped over and then the walls painted.
- The fireplace had been stuffed with rubbish and then sealed shut with cardboard and ductaped. I literally don\'t even know how they achieved that one. 

Basically, this property is an absolute disaster and this man shouldn\'t be allowed to be a landlord. 

There were plenty of other, smaller issues that we fixed ourselves, and we managed the mould issue with a lot of regular scrubbing. Overall, the property was in a much better state when we left than when we moved in. Despite this, he tried to keep £800 of the £1250 deposit. We argued and provided photographic evidence in a very lengthy document to the deposit protection scheme and in the end this was reduced to just £40 - because we left a perfectly good BBQ behind! The £40 was apparently for the removal of this item, despite the fact it would have cost him nothing to either a) take it to a skip, b) offered it to the next tenants or c) bulked it in with the removal of the rotting mattress, the contents of the sheds and the remaining contents of the attic. Still, this was a battle I didn\'t need while dealing with breast cancer and we did well to recover the majority of our deposit back.

If you have any other option available to you, I would recommend you avoid this house.",25-07-2020 08:28 AM,£1250

Serious dry rot in one of the bedrooms under the skirting boards. Landlord has said it is because we sometimes hang laundry indoors (eg when it is raining outdoors) and that therefore we need to pay for dry rot to be fixed.

The flat was a a good size and happily housed a couple. Although small there was really great storage! The bathroom was perfectly proportioned for the size of the flat and didn\\\'t feel pokey or cramped - the P shaped bath really made the best use of the space! The kitchen is small but perfectly formed, plenty of space to store the essentials - we sometimes found the fridge/freezer a struggle (under cabinet size only) after a big shop, but with a bit of careful arrangement it easily housed enough food for two! The living room was a great size and the compact table was perfect for space saving.Our favourite feature of the flat was the wall of shelving! This was an amazing use of the space and gave us all the storage we needed! We love the area (we bought a place across the park from Coleman Court) but as any Londoner will tell you no area is perfect - but we really never had any problems that affected us personally. Transport links are amazing - Southfields tube is a short walk as is Earlsfield mainline station. The local area provides everything you could need in terms of shops, eateries and bars/pubs, and leisure. We found contacting our landlord very easy - She was always fast to respond to emails or calls, and resolved any issues we had very quickly! We can highly recommend this flat!",17-05-2018 04:36 PM,

Chris could not be reasoned with by explaining to him how betterment works under the UK law, and his only responses were to tell us how bored he was of our requests, aggressive messages highlighting random sections of the tenancy agreement and threats of legal action. He cannot be reasoned with and, like many landlords, his greed became all too apparent at the end of the tenancy. I suggest that Chris takes a hard look in the mirror to consider why he should take tenants cash for basic maintenance (like painting a wall long after it’s usable life span is up) rather than paying for it out of the roughly £280k he has collected in rent since the last time these jobs were done. He also didn’t want to replace things like broken fridge shelves that on the original (seven year old) inventory were showing cracks due to age and repair. He was, however, generally good with other items of repair (such as when plumbing broke and the bathroom flooded) although I suspect that was only because that threatened the material value of the home. Never did one inspection in all the time we lived there either.

Also, the switch didn\'t make sense so we had to use our flashlights sometime to find our way around. Some sockets were missing that it was impossible to vacuum the living room.

First warning, the front room suffers from damp issues - especially in winter as the temperature drops (no i did not dry clothes in the room).  Despite keeping windows ajar every day I was still required to do a deep clean with strong mould spray every so often.  I lost several pairs of shoes and clothes to the mould issue.  Despige flagging this with the landlord several times, promises were made and nothing that made a vast change was done (only a replastering of a cupboard).

The landlord\'s handyman on retainers informed me that the house does not have any insulation!  So be weary!

The Landlord was also cheap - instead of hiring qualified professionals to do a job the handyman on retainer was always used.

Within 6 months of moving in the roof terrace was causing issues for the other flatmate (there was a whole in the roof above the room ceiling!).  Said handyman was brought in to fix.  A year later, the roof collapsed without warning!  Again landlord used said handyman instead of getting professionals/properly fixing the roof.

The property could do with some revamping, quite old internal wiring, kitchen and kitchen appliances are out of date and bathroom could d with a revamp.

We made the landlord aware of the issue and they told us that it was our problem to solve. We tried to capture them all but there are so many that they kept coming back.

The property is made to look okay but once you move in you find all sorts of problem. all repairs are done on the cheap for example the living room floor is uneven. it slants to back of the room. The kitchen floor has cheap bathroom lino on it so that when you put your fridge and washing machine down it tears it. the side is none scratch resistant or heat proof, it was all warn out by the time we moved out, top room was un-usable in winter because there is a hole in the wall to the outside covered with a plastics grate - kitchen floor poorly fitted holes connected to the basement, cold drafts- basement door has hole at the top letting in draft. - loads of spiders coming from basement, enough to constitute an infestation. This is not all but I feel these are the main points.

The landlord tried to take all but 9% of our bond off us, lots of reasons given,  I challenged this through the bond scheme and managed to get 75% back the loss was mainly on the cleaning and a few scrapes and scratches. It underlines the importance of taking pictures when you move in. I believe that the we could have gotten more back if we had done this.

It is not all doom and gloom the landlords do repairs quickly if they are cheap - they use unskilled work men though.

The boiler was constantly breaking, leaving me without heating and hot water in a cold house. The issue was alwats fixed reasonably quickly but tbh, the intrusiveness of having someone in my house so often was stressful and they should have just replaced the damn thing.

I ended up moving because there was an infestation of mice and the landlords waited 2 months to call in pest control and made me me live with vermin while they explored the cheapest options. I was so stressed, I couldn\'t sleep, and I ended up spending most of the time at my partner\'s so by the end I was paying for a house I didn\'t live in.

When I moved out, I paid for it to be professionally cleaned. The landlords insisted it wasn\'t clean, blamed me for existing damage, duplicated charges, and asked for disproportionate deductions through the letting agent. It was around £800 out of my £1100 deposit. The letting agent (Knightsbridge Lettings) was very intimidating when I said I\'d let the DPS decide. They reduced the charges, said I\'d get charged more if I went to the DPS and advised me to accept the deal they were offering. I refused.

On first inspection, the property appeared nice, clean and in good working order. It was not until we had our first check-in that litany of issues with the apartment became apparent. Most of the light fixtures did not work, the taps were non-functioning, the toilet was blocked, the heating did not work, the fridge and oven were broken, the storage spaces were filled with junk (mostly broken furniture, building materials and old, Urdu-language VHS tapes!), the electricity was on a key-meter and this had not been topped up (meaning the inspection was done in the dark), the locks were broken on the front door, several electricity sockets were non-functioning, even the furniture that was provided was dirty and damaged, but had been cleverly presented in a way that meant this was not obvious until closer inspection. As we had moved down from Manchester to move into this property we had arrived late on a Saturday afternoon and the letting agents, Winkworth New Cross, were finishing for the day by this point. When I called them and told them about all of these issues they were reluctant to do anything until Monday morning and it took a significant amount of arguing to get them to agree to send out an emergency repairman (I believe it was when I pointed out that I would not be able to go to the bathroom that they finally acquiesced). To top it all off, after the first night we awoke completely covered in bed-bug bites! 

First thing on Monday I presented to Winkworth’s office with an extensive list of issues that required fixing. They acted sympathetic and promised to get everything sorted but it took the best part of a month before all of the issues were resolved (at least they agreed to replace the bed and have the place fumigated as soon as possible!)

Sadly, this experience set the tone for the rest of the tenancy and we experienced various issues throughout our stay. Mould quickly built up around the windows despite them being left open (it did not help that the seals on the double glazing had perished on nearly every single window, thus allowing damp to accumulate in and around them). Winkworth were quick to blame us for this but on closer inspection I found evidence that mould had been present in the property for a while and the previous tenant (or Winkworth) had simply painted over it. The heating system was an electric boiler which, aside from being highly inefficient and expensive, broken down every few weeks – the landlord refused to replace it and instead had every single part of it replaced using second-had parts (sadly this made for a lot of cold showers in the winter). One month after moving in, the wall-mounted shelves that the landlord had provided fell off the wall, destroying everything that was on or under them. The agents were quick to send the repairman out on this occasion to remove them and fix the holes they had left in the wall and, on inspection, he asserted that these were ‘not weight-bearing shelves’ as the wall was too soft to support such weight. 

Eventually the landlord tired of having to pay for these various repairs and, cleverly, told the agents that repairs could only be carried out with his permission and then began ignoring their attempts to contact him. 

The building itself was an odd, 50/50 mix of perfectly nice people and anti-social reprobates which meant we were frequently disturbed by loud parties, domestic disputes and the occasional police raid. In fairness, the company managing the property were fairly helpful in dealing with anti-social tenants but as soon as such one group was evicted another would take their place. The neighbourhood was of a similar character and their would often be incidents of petty crime, anti-social behaviour and even gang-fights and fatal stabbings in the immediate vicinity. Indeed, I was once woken up at 4am on a Tuesday by the sound of 6 large men having a melee immediately outside our bedroom window. 

When I finally left the property I had to spend 6 weeks arguing with Winkworth regarding the deposit. It was 14 days before they eventually replied to my enquires – I pointed out that at this point they were legally obligated to return my deposit without deductions but apparently they were unfamiliar with basic tenancy law. They demanded to know where the aforementioned, non-weight bearing shelves were – they had no record of them falling down and demanded I pay for them. They demanded to know where all the broken furniture from the storage spaces were – again, they had no record of agreeing to remove them as they were clearly beyond repair. They then insisted that the property, having now been empty for 3 weeks since I left, had become dusty and needed a full professional clean which I should pay for. Eventually, following the exchange of some very loud words and threats of litigation, they backed down and returned my deposit in full. 

To cut a very long story short – avoid this property and its agents if you can. The amount of rent they charge for a property of this type, in this neighbourhood, is exorbitant and you can get far more for your money (and live in a much nicer area) if you look slightly further away from the city centre.

Later on, she said that only 24 hours notice was necessary and that it did not have to be at a convenient time for us. She often appeared on a Saturday morning – the most inconvenient time for those that work 9-5, 5 days a week and want to enjoy their free time. Her inspections increased, at one point, to twice a week for two weeks. We cleaned the flat regularly, but she expected the flat to be absolutely spotless – i.e. not lived in. For example, she complained several times about dust on top of the doorframes and watermarks in the sink.

•	The landlady would send her brother, who lived in the building, to the flat to inspect it or if we had a problem that needed fixing. He was incredibly rude and unhelpful and not what we signed up for. On one occasion he let himself into our flat without notice. It made me feel incredibly nervous living there on my own (my housemate was away a lot), knowing that he had a key.

•	It got to the point that I was scared to be in the flat on my own. My housemate would be away for months at a time for work and I became incredibly anxious living there, knowing that she could come over with only 24hrs notice, and that her brother had a key to the flat. 
•	The tenancy agreement clearly stated that the landlord/landlady should not infringe upon the tenants ‘quiet enjoyment of the flat’ – she did. 

•	One Saturday, when the landlady came for an inspection, she was particularly aggressive towards me. She did not realise that my boyfriend was in my bedroom and, when he heard how rude she was being towards me, he politely asked her not to speak to me in that way. She immediately put her hand in his face saying ‘I am not talking to you’ and said that he could never visit the flat again. After this incident, Neda became convinced that we had other people living in the flat. 

•	When I was in the process of signing for a new flat, I was asked to give the contact details of my current landlord so that they could provide a reference. I asked the landlady’s permission to do this and she asked me to ring her. On the phone, she said that I had been an awful tenant and that, to give me a good reference would be a lie. However, she said that she also wanted me gone from the flat, and so preceded to blackmail me by saying that she would only give me a good reference if I promised to get the flat professionally cleaned after moving out. Since it had been my intention to do this anyway, I agreed. Needless to say, having said that she would give me a reference, she didn’t and ignored all phone calls and emails from Let Alliance when they tried to contact her for one. As a consequence, I had to provide my previous 6 months of bank statements to prove that I had paid my rent on time.


I paid for the flat to be professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy. The plastic sofa had a slight rip on the seam. The DSA advised me that it was fair wear and tear as you can see where the other seam was ripping. However, the landlady said that we had to pay for a new sofa. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme clearly states that: “Landlords should therefore keep in mind that the tenant’s deposit is not to be used like an insurance policy where you might get “full replacement value” or “new for old”.”In the end she asked for £150 towards it, which we paid because, by that point we were exhausted by the back and forth arguing.

Contains a hallway with one bathroom, one bedroom, a living room and a kitchen. Also was a fully furnished flat, which was helpful at the time. Unfortunately the living room is stocked with mainly glass furniture which are easily breakable, some were already broken when I moved in. 

Also months into the tenancy, I could see that although it looked superficially well done, it wasn’t of high quality as hallway linoleum floor slats moved frequently and exposed the bare wooden floor underneath, the kitchen had holes everywhere in the corners of the floor and the there were and are an abundance of spiders and other insects especially at the front door and outside of the property which was extremely dirty and kept in poor condition. 

2 months into the tenancy, discovered an issue with the kitchen taps and no release of hot water which went on for almost a year as it was tried to be fixed by several different engineers. The boiler broke down twice leaving me freezing and unable to shower in the middle of winter that my mother had to drive all the way from London just to provide me with an electric heater (as I am disabled), and there were issues with the electricity and the toilet.

I was told by several engineers that visited the property that the tank and water system are ancient and belong in antiquity which is why they had a tendency to break down every few months. A complete overhaul of the tank and water system would be needed but the landlord unwilling to fork out for such a cost, refused to follow their recommendations.

Regarding the landlord, she was a very vindictive landlord who took an instant dislike to me because I reported and chased up all the repair issues needed in the flat. She appeared to be content with me living in a flat paying a very high amount of money which she increased after a year without any dispute from me yet I couldn’t use hot water in the kitchen taps. Halfway through the tenancy during a particularly bad repair issue whereby I had no heating for a few days, my mother tried to call and speak to reason with her and she cut the phone on her and refused to engage with me directly since then, only going through the agent.

She made a point at the start of the tenancy to make me take down her number and message her if there were any issues, but when I proceeded to do just that she appeared annoyed and implied that I should only be contacting the estate agency so as not to disturb her. 

Worse of all, she came every few months to pick up her mail which she failed to redirect, so I had to separate my mail from hers and she would drop by at any time usually only giving me a few hours notice to collect her mail.",18-07-2023 08:55 PM,£950

Definitely not recommended. The price was high to start with but we unfortunately had ran out of other options. The landlords became more hostile as the tenancy progressed, as they seemed to be reasonable at first but gradually and by the end of the tenancy seemed to turn unfairly sour and expected unreasonable levels of strict behaviour and cleanliness far above and beyond what the flat was like at the start of the tenancy and we had to fight to get our sizeable deposit back, even with deductions. The paperwork/process in general was quite disoncerting with little assurance that our payments were actually going where they were meant to. The landlords were pretty rude and unfair about us during and especially after leaving in correspondence. Even though it is advertised as being appropriate for students, any levels of noise or disruption or cleanliness less than completely pristine were not well tolerated so we would not recommend this for students. We also felt misled by the fact that we found it on a large online property website yet never had the option of direct contact or support from that company and instead dealt exclusively with the landlords who had simply used that website to advertise their property and discouraged us from contacting them.
Logistically, it is quite an anti-social property as there are no shared communal areas and flats are far apart so we never really met or socialised with the other residents and it was pretty lonely. No parking was available so moving in and out was a bit of a nightmare, relying on carrying items from random car park spaces in the nearest local park. Since then we have had much more comfortable experiences dealing with professional estate agents and would always recommend that you go for those instead of these landlords who are not professional and have unreasonable expectations on tenants.
Furniture generally was not in good condition and was either strangely pieced together or unusable for the bed, some tables and chairs which were sticky. The flies were a huge problem, flying in and out of the flat in swarms and whilst this was not exclusively the fault of the landlords as they seemed to fly in and out as they pleased if the windows were open (which they had to be as the flat got very hot at all times of year) some warning/assistance would have helped as bug bites were all too frequent. The lighting was naturally pretty dim when you were far away from the windows. The oven was not in a nice condition to start with (untreatably dirty) and the bathroom lacking in wallpaper/mould prevention on the walls/ceiling/bath/other surfaces.
They also somehow did not seem to know how the electricity worked (there is no gas) so we had to find that out all by ourselves and were without electricity for a few days while we had to contact and liaise with the electricity company. There are definitely many better options at much cheaper prices. The advertised rent was actually less than we had to pay in reality as the landlords advertised rent was every 28 days without bills so actual monthly costs (every 30/31 days) were considerably higher. We would absolutely recommend people look elsewhere at professional estate agents\' properties. Also, general advice: take photos of all furniture in your rented property wherever you go when you move in so you can use those as evidence to them if needed (this would have made getting our deposit back slightly easier/possible when they accused us of leaving the apartment in a decrepid state which was frankly ridiculous as we cleaned it to a considerably better state than we found it in and a very reasonable state to the same standard as professional cleaners).",02-10-2021 01:39 AM,£740

It should be noted that the property is quite old, dating back to the 17th century.

The owners, at the time of my letting, with the help of the letting agency, disputed my deposit (of five weeks rent), made false and grossly inaccurate claims to the Deposit Protection Scheme (DPS), including unofficial claims not listed in their offiical submission to the DPS. In fact, the total of the owners\' claims on the deposit exceeded the deposit by about £30. The DPS, after considering the matter for almost 6 weeks, rejected their claims, and noted that it was their obligation to prove their claims, and not the tenant\'s to disprove theirs, and that the owners had not proved their claims. The DPS also rebuked the owners and the letting agency for including unofficial claims on the deposit.

The main claim by the owner related to damage to the plaster on the living room ceiling caused by water leaking from a standing bath upstairs. This happened within months of moving in, and was immediately reported by me to the letting agents. The letting agency did nothing for five months, and then sent a local contractor who was also unable to do anything. Clearly, there was a pre-existing defect in the bath, or the tiling, that allowed water to leak through the ceiling. It was not fit for purpose, and the owners should have realised this, before letting the property. 

The unofficial claims on the deposit included spurious claims for \""gardening costs\"", despite being presented with very recent invoices for garden trimming jobs by a local private contractor, and also a charge to re-attach the owner\'s dishwasher in place of my washing machine, something which I have never been asked to do in any previous letting.

The owners were ultimately responsible for responding to maintenance issues, but this was generally quite unsatisfactory.

The property may have changed hands, but if you are a tenant here, be aware of the bath, the garden, and the fact that house is more than three centuries old.",09-09-2021 03:32 PM,£1195

Landlord does nothing but lie and avoid situations, used the excuse of being in and out of prison in Vietnam to avoid replacing illegal boiler. Also got responses from him saying \""well you could always intvite your friends around for a gang bang to warm up the house\"" and \""you should count yourselves lucky it\'s 40 degrees here i\'d kill for a cold shower\""

didn\'t place our deposit in the legally required saftey schemes and there is no way of getting him to do it or getting it from him as he isnt in the uk.

pending legal action on him now which will be a long process.

The most prolific would have been the heavy mould issue in the bathroom ceiling and on several walls including the kitchen. There were some major plumbing issues and regular blockage of the drains. Eventually after much persistence we had a wall repaired and the house was painted, some furniture was also replaced. Whilst I would say that the agents were always polite, they were a bit slow to respond to the requests, often the excuse being they did not receive the email or could not recall meeting with us. The property is in a good location as a commuter to the city you would benefit a lot from the tube station within walking distance. Our bedroom was on the first floor and whilst the street are relatively quiet, there were a few occasions where people would stand outside and converse quite loudly. I spotted a few mice at the property but their sightings usually coincided with blocked drains and heavy rains. The garden is relatively low maintenance as it is paved but there is an issue with mouldy growths from excessive moisture in parts. The property is dark inside, on the ground floor you need the lights on in the day. There is a reception room on the ground floor which was used as a bedroom but the house is clearly a 3 bed with all the bedrooms on the first floor. As a multiple let for strangers, it is over crowded as there is only one small bathroom. As a let for a family, its a good size. The kitchen and bathroom needs serious attention. The walls have cracks and moisture. The single  bedroom upstairs is almost uninhabitable as it is freezing, and mould ridden. We cleaned it and repainted twice out of our own pockets. The guttering needs attention as it is allowing moisture to go into the walls. Damp re-proofing much needed. The inner staircase is broken and has been repaired by us, but not officially by a builder from the agency (the issue was brought up but not attended to).  If the owner of the property was interested in investing some money into a total upgrade not only to make it cosmetically beautiful but also safer and warmer, this would be an ideal property to rent.

For that reason I would likely not recommend this property unless they have someone managing it. Otherwise its a lovely house and good neighbourhood.",18-04-2017 05:44 AM,£2750

It took weeks and sometimes months to get any essential repairs done. Most of the issues were from before we moved in but were not noticeable during the viewings. We had no electricity in the back bedroom and kitchen for a few weeks after moving in and had to try calling him for weeks to get it fixed. We were told by the electrician who finally came that it was a patched electrical job and should never have been rented in such a condition. 

Water from the gutters came gushing into the kitchen through the boiler exhaust pipe and flooded the kitchen. We had to wait a few weeks to get the roofers in to fix the gutters and block the hole. Also there was a huge safety risk with the windows. Located at the front of the property, they could not be locked and the main large window could be pushed from the outside in so anyone could come in and leave the property easily with large items. We were not made aware of this and when we noticed it it took weeks to get permission to secure them which we did at our expense and never got reimbursed. They had to be secured in such a way that we could not open them for the rest of the year of our tenancy. 

The toilet seat broke and it took a year to get it replaced. It was an unusual shape so I couldn\'t just source it myself so we had a broken seat for nearly a year which I had to tape up and secure to the toilet bowl so we wouldn\'t fall. Due to the flat being on the ground floor, we had to keep on top of the mould problem by cleaning the walls behind furniture and using a dehumidifier every day. The numerous workmen who had to come to our flat were all shocked it had been rented out with such important underlying problems. 

To top it off the landlord wanted to increase the rent by 11% if we renewed our contract for the next year without addressing the unfinished issues. We moved into a new flat and have never been happier.",31-03-2016 12:50 PM,£1650

We were not given any details about our landlord and had to get his sister’s number (they both rent out flats in the building) from our neighbour in order to try and sort the maintenance issues.

When we moved out, we made sure to clean the entire property thoroughly. If anything it was in a better condition than when we moved in, but we made the error of not taking photographic evidence.

I cleaned it with mould remover, and even ordered in hospital-grade cleaner, which did nothing. Within days the mould was back and worse than ever.

Secondly, every window in this three bedroom flat leaked. The master bedroom window leaked so bad, there were pools of water on the sill after every rain. The other windows in the house would seep in water, too.

Thirdly, the electrics were an utter shambles. Plug sockets were hanging off the walls, half of them didn\'t work, and there was cabling running next to the bath and toilet waste pipes.
Where they had installed mains wired fire alarms, they had moved the light fitting and left a hole with dangling wires.

Despite informing the Estate Agents if these issues, nothing was ever done. We eventually had to move as I got so ill with the mould, I had to be put on steroids for the damage it had done to my lungs.

Although the people seem very friendly and polite, it was impossible to get them to fix simple things, like a broken dishwasher basket or a leaky tap. 

The flat does not have a stand-alone shower. You will have to sit in a bath tub and wash yourself to avoid water being all over the bathroom floor. The landlord refused to even consider installing a glass screen saying it’s too expensive.

The flat gets VERY hot in the summer. Like +36C hot all day. Very difficult to sleep at night, let alone be in the flat during the day. Opening all windows does not help much. 

Also, the flat is advertised as a two bedroom, whereas in reality the second room cannot be classified as a bedroom - tiny non-opening windows and no heating.

The property was not managed by an agency just rented through it. They made no effort to fix the issues. The issues are as follows:

- The house is not appropriately insulated and allows for ALL the heat to escape, despite multiple beggings for them to fix it we were forced to live in a freezing house. 
- They pretend there are radiators when in fact there are storage heaters which is not the same.
- Overnight heating on boiler not working despite claims from landlord to repair it
- Overnight temperature downstairs is 14 degrees; enough to wake up like an icicle.
-  The landlord makes promises and never delivers and what is worse thinks it\'s funny that the shower hardly has any water coming out of it. 
- The house needed a thorough renovation 50 years ago, and much more now.
- They managed to install some foam upstairs to insulate the house marginally. 
- The bathroom window has a permanent ventilation hole with no radiator so again, deep freeze.
- The flooring and the wood is poor, there is no space and the living room has been transformed into a double room.
- furnished property that came with broken chairs that did not match - sat down and fell. if that was my father he\'d be dead now. 
- the shower hardly works and the landlord claims he will repair but doesnt.

The landlord doesn\'t care about the property and the agency didn\'t care either.

Rented to students who were treated like cattle. Inappropriate as the houses nearby were in a good state and this one is overpriced (1150) compared to the one right next to it rented for less money (around 900) in a better state.

But unfortunately that is where the good bit ends. I think the house itself needs major renovation. There are two receptions which are very small and not appropriate for a young bustling family. We had difficulty inviting anybody over as there was barely any space for an extra person or two sit down in the small reception. The property itself had not been extended at the rear unlike pretty much every property on the street, making the living area extremely cramped. This is particularly relevant given the high market equivalent rents we were paying (we would have paid similar or lower rents for extended, renovated properties). The carpets are very worn and clearly need replacing. The only reason we moved in the first place was because of an emergency situation involving another property, where we risked being stranded as a young family, so we took the first property that we could move in at the earliest. Our younger child was born after we moved in and this made it difficult for us to move out immediately.

Further, we had a very difficult experience dealing with both the landlord as well as estate agents. The landlord was described by the agent himself as being \'pernickety\' and that I think describes the behavior best. Minor issues were raised towards the end of our tenancy for which we were charged anywhere from 5-200 pounds. We got the strong feeling of being taken advantage of and a guise of renovating several things in the house which are bound to be impacted by wear and tear (Especially with a family with two young kids). It needs to remembered that we had lived in this house for three years, never had any delayed rents, never haggled about anything much. I think, in all fairness, we were very good tenants and behaved how we would like to be treated if we were on the other side. 

I think landlords should appreciate the difference between intentional damage to the property vs accidental damage vs wear and tear that is natural over time. The first two should be repaired by tenants, the last should be resolved amicably. Many of the complaints against us fit the last description and I knew if I raised this to arbitration, it would be resolved in our favour. Further, I think landlords like this one need to recognise the common sense logic of renting to trustworthy people who will take care of their property and look at the bigger picture.

Our property was managed by the estate agent Venture Properties who were overall very organised and helpful. When we moved in there was a leak under the sink for which they quickly arranged for a plumber to fix. They could have done more to pressure the plumber to fix the problem and chosen a more reliable company, as the one they chose took more than a week to come out leaving us without water for a week. 

House was very clean on moving in and was easy to keep clean. Very efficient heating meant energy bills were low and the house heats up to room temperature naturally spring to autumn. North and east facing windows meant that we only got sun in the morning and this combined with a lack of any outdoor space made us feel cramped at times.

We\'ve rented for several years and have never experienced it to this extent. The day we moved in, I found their cousin peeking through the blinds, I was a bit perplexed but introduced myself to her. A day later, we had an email from the landlord saying there were too many people living in the property and they were concerned we had too much stuff as \'many neighbours\' reported lots of boxes coming in and 4 men sitting in the living room. They were my partner and his brothers and only the people listed on the tenancy stayed there. 

Mould was reported several times, they did nothing and said we should get a dehumidifer. We did and emptied it several times a day, my baby developed asthma and it was awful. Electricity bills were huge too because we needed windows open to air it (and expensive to run the dehumidifer). It was really terrible and it\'s a problem that plagues many of the flats there.

Any slight issue and the landlady would come round herself, plus regular inspections and also whenever she was local (they are based in Singapore a lot of the time but have neighbours upstairs). It was intrusive, but she was polite and friendly as was the landlord - to me.

We\'d agreed we\'d all like to extend the tenancy. Unfortunately, one day the landlord came round when my partner was there too. He took one look at my black partner (I am white) and just would not look at him. He immediately made excuses to leave. Shortly after, the lettings agent called and asked if I\'d like help to find somewhere to rent. I was confused as we\'d already agreed the extension. Apparently, the landlord - upon meeting my black partner - had decided to issue a Section 21 and evict us. It was in the post and arrived the next day. They wouldn\'t answer any contact and put the flat back on the market for the same price and advertised it to families just like us.

When we moved out, they tried to steal our deposit. They said we\'d let mould build up and never mentioned it to them. Luckily we had proof of everything and had left the flat in a spotless condition and had photos to prove it, so we got our deposit back. But it took a very long time as we had to contest it through the appeals process.

Avoid at ALL costs. We also had bikes stolen, Christmas presents stolen and my identity stolen while we lived there. But most of the neighbours are absolutely lovely and so is the area.",03-05-2021 07:58 AM,£1650

Somewhat tatty and not been refurbished for a long time with old, stained carpets and curtains, cracked paint etc. The more important issues with this property stem from the landlady (Deborah Turner) and the way in which the property was managed. The landlady lives overseas and wants little to do with the property - she appeared for a couple of hours on check in and check out. Serious issues such as a faulty gas fireplace (unsafe) were either not fixed satisfactorily, took huge amounts of correspondence and pushing or were not fixed.

The major issue here though is the financial management. We were able to meet the previous tenants in order to give them some mail that had arrived, they had moved locally. They said we should be very careful with the deposit when checking out, we listened but were not sure exactly what the problem was. They did say they were having to fight to get their deposit back. When we left at the end of the tenancy having looked after the property well and left it in better condition than when when we moved in, we then understood what the previous tenants meant.

The landlady did an inspection (before we moved out but when we were not there so could not comment on her observations) and sent a list of issues she wanted to keep money for. This was for most of the £4,500 deposit. We were shocked! We replied with detailed answers to her points however she just did not respond to what she said and continued to press for money. Fortunately we had taken photographs of all issues/marks in the house the day after we moved in - these had been emailed to the landlady at the time, and also when she raised issues upon checkout. We provide detailed explanations on each problem she wanted us to pay for, sent copies of emails with her from during he tenancy, and resent t photographs. However when repkying she chose to ignore our explanations and not respond the points made, to ignore th  photographic evidence and ignore the copies of email correspondence! For example, she wanted money for a wooden island top to be resanded - we even had a photo of the poor condition it was in when we moved in. Landlady said it had been newly sanded and varnished before we moved in - nonsense. She wanted us to pay for an aerial on the roof to be repaired - we had not even had terrestrial TV. Many other items also. It became clear she was just out to get as much money from our deposit as possible and not to consider the evidence supplied. This was very frustrating. Her communication became aggressive and inappropriately unprofessional.

This had to go through the dispute process with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme - we raised a case. It takes a lot of time to be thorough in contesting the landlady\'s dishonesty point by point but the photos and email evidence we had kept every time we communicated with her meant the outcome was we were asked to pay less than £200 from the deposit instead of the £4,000 she wanted. Fortunately the TDS is there to stop dishonest landlords from stealing from tenants and we were protected as a result. I would strongly recommend not renting this property as it seems the landlady tries it on at the end of all tenancies to steal money from tenants\' deposits as they leave (as evidenced by the tenants before us, and us). It\'s sad people like this are still allowed to rent out properties and try to take advantage of people. Fortunately we were prepared so she didn\'t get away with it. Avoid. There are better properties for similar money in the area with far more honest landlords who act with integrity. I hope renters see this and avoid the frustration we went through, at least she didn\'t get away with it in the end.",15-08-2017 05:32 AM,£0

For example broken drawers, broken slats under the bed, windows painted shut (fire hazard) were never fixed and therefore  we had to resolve these ourselves. 
Damp and peeling paint in the bathroom  was not dealt with till a year after we reported it and only when we had given notice that we were leaving. Boiler broke and needed replacing, the landlord did not give the go ahead for it to be replaced for a month after receiving the quotes and only when we were in our last two weeks of being in the flat.
Also the furniture in the flat was old or broken, eg sofa , living room rug, vacuum cleaner, kitchen bin. The sofa was very uncomfortable and the land lord would not replace it or allow us to. The rug was quite worn and again the landlord would not replace it or allow us to. The bin and the vacuum were broken and we were not allowed to dispose of them as the landlord wants to keep them for the next tenant.
The neighbours were nice but could be noisy, they occasionally had friends over in the garden till early hours in the morning and because the bedroom backs on to the garden and was not double glazed the noise when it happened was very intrusive.
There is a very popular pub across the road from the flat and when not in COVID times was open till early hours in the morning on the weekend and therefore noise was quite loud at the front of the flat. However the pub did try hard  in trying to keep people quiet and move them on when they left the pub.
The flat is in a great location and had some nice features, the kitchen was okay and there is a lot of storage space and the garden is very big and spacious if quite shade, but for the amount of money we paid I would have expected the landlord to be slightly attentive.",12-05-2021 11:30 AM,£1600

The property is a beautiful period property with high ceilings and large bay windows. My flat was the perfect size for me as a student/young professional, a large kitchen-lounge, a decent sized bedroom and bathroom. Furniture was provided by the landlord and was good quality. In the winter the property was quite cold probably due to it being an old building, the flat had electric heating which meant in the coldest months was a bit expensive to heat the flat.
Landlords: Virginia and David Gatherer
Virginia and David were the best landlords I\'ve ever had. The move in process was very smooth and the flat was perfectly clean, Virginia even offers help with setting up your bills which was very helpful for me as this was my first time renting after living in student halls. I saw them both on a regular basis as they owned a lot of properties in the street so were around a lot doing odd jobs. They were fantastic with any repairs that needed doing, getting them done quickly and were also very helpful by being there when any workmen/plumbers etc were coming and I couldn\'t be in due to being at work. Every week David would put the communal bins out for collection so none of the tenants had to worry about this. The property had high ceilings so they even changed the lightbulbs for me when needed. Virginia\'s communication with us was fantastic, always informing us if there were to be any workmen around the properties, if she would be showing people around etc. Overall Virginia and David were great landlords, as someone that moved to Sunderland from out of the area on my own I felt very lucky to have them as my landlords and felt I could ask them for any assistance I needed.
Area:
or me the property was the perfect location. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the University of Sunderland city campus which is where I was based as a student. It also less than 15 minutes walk from Sunderland Hospital which was perfect for me as this where I worked during and after my degree. There is a metro station at the end of the street, less than 2 minutes walk, providing easy access to Newcastle. The city centre is about 15 minutes walk away. There is an aldi about 20 minutes walk away, a morrisons petrol station around the corner and also a small corner shop less than a minute away. As a student or young professional working in the city centre this would be the perfect location for you to live. The property is quite close to a main road which could be slightly noisy at busy times.",09-06-2021 03:20 PM,

Kitchen sink block. It will remain an issue forward though we as tenants, hired an engineer to fix it three times along. I did so because landlord responses slower than she should and sent nasty, rude, unprofessional men to fix it poorly. And landlord has not paid back to me yet. More importantly, it will still be an issue as the kitchen pipe was set up in a wrong way, so that new drainage will keep blocking the sink, according to expert advice I seek, unless landlord will pay to re-install the sink pipe properly, which is highly unlikely as I observe. 

2. Condensation or mould issues. The main bedroom has a gas pipe built INSIDE it, again in a wrong and stupid way. Water condensates on the pipe and no carbon monoxide indicator is installed. The main bedroom is thus very damp in winter. This is against the law severely. The bath room is slightly better but the fan is too weak to help. We had to open windows each time after showering in whatever weather. 

3. The carpets in two rooms are quite old and it takes a lot of efforts to clean them. 

3. Mice were found in 2015 winter. Though we purchased poison to kill them, mice feces are still identified in the kitchen as recent as Dec/2016. 

4. Induction process by landlord and estate agent. It was done poorly or more precisely, it was not done at all. Agent leaded me into the flat and when I challenged him that it was not properly cleaned, he boldly said I need to clean it myself. Landlady did not appear at all on the first I moved in, and snobbishly left an inventory without any photo taken. Also the inventory contained wrong readings of meters. Be careful about that! 

5. Landlord/Managing agents. A simple word for Landlord and Landlady: horrible. They are ignorant, and rude. But landlady carries an additional feature: smarmy. As to agents, I met several of them. They are generally sneaky, coward. I say so because they appear harsh but become soft when I challenge them with the law. 

6. Deposit refund. Landlady claims to charge me for \'professional cleaning\', though the flat was not professionally cleaned when I moved in. I am still working to request for my deposit back. 

7. Therefore stay away from this property and its landlord/landlady including its agent Foxton.",13-12-2016 08:25 PM,£1150

Cold.  Noisy from upstairs. Great bedroom view. Cool Building.  Bare-bones letting agent who ignores you.  Great location in town.


The walls are fairly dented/scratched, you can tell there hasn\'t been any redecorating in a fairly long time.  There\'s especially a huge hole in one door . (a couple inches tall) which they were asked to but never did fix.

You can hear upstairs talking and their footsteps, but not any of the other neighbours.  No-one played loud music whilst we were there.  The bedroom side is quiet, although my partner could hear when busses go past (I couldn\'t).  You can hear a small amount of general road noise from the lounge side.

There is a large building opposite the road (lounge side) which is due for demolition - it\'s been waiting to come down for 8 months, unsure when that will start.

The heating is very old night storage, and is not really worth using.  It heats up with cheaper electricity overnight, and then slowly releases heat throughout the day.  Heating has a mode designed to release heat slower early in the day so you still have heating in the evening, but during winter most of the heat dissapates by mid-afternoon despite this (they are very old units).  Turning up the heating to full input does get the winter temperature above 16 for most of the day, so it\'s not illegal, but was impractically expensive to run.  Was without heating for a month waiting for the landlord/agency to fix.  1 week of this was fair as plumbers were waiting for parts, but the other 3 weeks was the landlord/letting agency being slow.

No pets were allowed, no photos were allowed to be hung.   Several requests for minor repairs (a loose/wobbly tap, a hole in a door etc..) were ignored.  Charged £60 for end of tenancy cleaning despite in our opinion it being cleaner than we received the flat.  Talk lots of your own photos when you move in.

Was told on viewing (not in contract) that there are communal cupboards in the hallway, but this was untrue (well they\'re communal, but not for flat 3).

Dangerously close to Waitrose.  The honeyborne cycle path runs behind the house and is great for running/walking.

The one issue was when the boiler broke but considering that the property was purchased 3 weeks before I moved in there was no way the landlord could have done anything to prevent it breaking and in the event did everything humanly possible to get it fixed quickly.  Compared to other properties in the area the rent is incredibly reasonable; anything else at this price is either the size of a shoebox or has a really odd layout.  The area is also really nice.  I\'m sorry to be leaving (moving overseas).,28-11-2016 03:19 PM,£0

For the rent and the studio flat description you get a good amount of space for one person and in the end my partner moved in as well which just about worked! The private woodland behind is a great addition to the property as well. The main two issues were the damp - when we left we found the back of the sofa to be covered with mould and the bathroom was incredibly damp and needed a dehumidifier running it in constantly. I know this is often a problem with basement flats but after we moved out the landlady appeared to be painting over the mould with damp proofing where as what it really needed was better ventilation. The other issue was the boiler, which may well have been updated by now, but it was faulty and even a professional plumber who came round to check it couldn\'t get it to run at any less than 100% so to avoid baking alive in there we had to switch it off for most of the time. This affected my gas bill, which took a rather long time to pay off.

On our first day on the property, I noticed a severe mold/ damp issue, rat or rodent droppings, and missing pieces around the house. None of these issues were made known to us before we decided to rent. I reported said issues the same day, no reply from our property managers. The rodent infestation was the worst. Rats would chew their way through floors and walls, (I don\'t know if it was the previous tenant or the landlord that decided the best way to combat the problem was to stuff tin foil in the holes.) and leave urine and droppings in the kitchen, we could hear them in the walls. We got nowhere with our estate agents and in the end had to call our own pest control and pay out of pocket, for our first week in the house! Over the next 8 or so weeks, we emailed and called relentlessly about our serious mold issue in my bedroom! It got to a point I had to sleep in the living room as my breathing was getting poor, nausea, headaches, etc not to mention the silverfish and other insects that now infested my room due to the humid environment. In the end, I could no longer wait for our estate agents and had to clean it myself. The room was so damp the paint peeled off all the way down to plaster, on 2 of my walls. I found 3 large black mold clusters, from which more mold and dampness were spreading. I took 2 months of our own work and money just to make the property livable. The dampness and mold is still an ongoing problem. Are estate agents no help at all. They have terrible communication, and customer service, and honestly lost all my trust that they can help us with any of our problems. For example, the plumbing in our bathroom is shot to hell and creates a recurring blockage, and leaks from our toilet. The longer we spend time in the house the more issue we discover. This house is held together by ducktape and paper. I would not be surprised if they used ramen noodles to fix holes in the walls. Overall this house is old, humid, and moldy, with poor ventilation, poor or no insulation, noise pollution from our next-door or upstairs neighbors, and a terrible experience with our estate agents.",23-01-2023 11:50 AM,

Mould is a major headache. Landlord expects dehumidifiers to be on all the time ( this raises electric bill a lot!) and air extractors to be switched on all the time, the one in the kitchen sounds like an airplane taking off! Black mould on furniture, bath, walls and curtains. 
Sky rocket energy prices - no gas supply and old 60s style heaters that conserve the heat at night and release at day time. This basically means you are throwing money away if you work during the day.IIf you want fast heat up - be ready for stink from the burning dust bits inside the heaters

4. On top of everything, Landlord did repair work of pipes and heated during 3 weeks while we were stayed in and didn\'t compensate a penny! 

There were many other examples like the above which I don\'t remember at the moment. Overall experience was very stressful, Landlord even showed up in the flat randomly once and said it was time for the flat checkup early morning, threatening with his cousin lawyer in every other word. Landlord even stressed so much future tenant that, he(future tenant) came to the property at night and asked me if Landlord was adequate at all. It\'s the shame Landlord seems very nice in the beginning when I met, seems it was just a mask.

So hopefully this review will be future tenants to make the right decision.",29-06-2020 11:36 AM,£1550

I lived here for nearly two years. The broadband is impossibly slow and there is nothing you can do about it. Although the landlords are the daughter and son of the people who live in the same grounds, it is in fact the parents who act like landlords, constantly checking up on what you are doing, proper busy bodies. 
I asked if I could plant shrubs, they approved this, so I spent 300 pounds on plants for the garden, three months later they asked me to pull them all out as they thought they might poison the garden. 
The worst if the electric gate right next to all the bedroom windows, it clatters open constantly as people drive down to the \'big house\' and make you constantly on edge. Also, the tenant is the one who pays for the electric on the gate as it is metered in the house. On top of this, at 5am EVERY morning including Sundays, the paper van comes through it, waking everyone up on the clock, to deliver the big house\'s newspapers. 
When you are out in the garden there is no privacy, the landlords are constantly out there on their ride on mower, and it is just never peaceful or relaxing, even though it looks it from the outside. It looks really pretty but don\'t be fooled. The road it is on becomes a motorway rat run at 6pm and BOTH my cats were run over, one is now brain damaged, the other has three legs. 
The first year I lived there they left asbestos in the kitchen, I was absolutely livid as I asked them if it was asbestos so they sent their bog it builder man over who said it wasn\'t. A year later it turns out that it was as I insisted on a professional re-check it as so many people had told me it looked like asbestos right over my cooker. 
Generally, it was awful experience and really expensive for a crammed small 3 bedroom house with no storage and awful bathrooms. The landlords have completely skimped and left most of it as an 80s house and don\'t care about their tenants staying long term, they are just greedy, and beware, the landlord neighbour is also an ex-judge and both the husband and wife are extremely condescending. Forget about ever getting fibre broadband. Even though it\'s next to a housing estate in Bovey it is 2.5 miles from the exchange and on a copper wire and very very slow so no netflix and no gaming for your kids. A horrible place all in all even though it looks pretty from the outside. Don\'t rent it, it will make you stressed, sleep deprived, your pets will be injured or killed, and you will feel constantly watched, not a home at all.",12-06-2018 11:19 AM,

They are extremely slow to respond to any issue and for the 3 years of our tenancy, we had to constantly chase them - including for issues regarding heating and hot water. They often behave in ways that are essentially unlawful, i.e. they did not fix heating and hot water issues within the timeframe stated by law. We did not have enough hot water for more than a year, due to their (and the landlady\'s) refusal to replace a non working water tank. The boiler had to be on for 5 hours in order to heat up an extremely old water talk with capacity for two 10-minute showers. 

We did not have heating that worked at a good enough standard for two years. The boiler in the property is extremely inefficient due to its age, but the landlords refuse to replace it even though the gas engineer has recommended replacing it every year since 2019. In addition, the property is extremely poorly insulated, which results in a very cold house even with the heating on. 

Furthermore, it took them 6 days to replace a broken fridge and an entire month to find a tree surgeon to reduce a long branch of a tree that literally only took 5 minutes in the end. Hobdays inspect the property a few times a year but do not tell you about this before signing the contract and do not give a reasonable window of time for when to expect them. They are very quick to follow up, though, if they need something from their tenants instead. 

The landlords of this property have also refused to fix issues like leaking taps, a barely working toilet flush, and very severe mould issues in various places in the property, due to very poor insulation. In fact, they asked us to paint over the mould on walls, and never took any responsibility for it despite us sending the agency photos of the walls and some of our belongings being covered in mould. We have, as a result of all this, suffered with cough and chilblains in the winter.  
When we first moved in we had to ask them to replace door handles in certain rooms in order for the doors to close, as they expected people to live there without even having doors that close in the bedrooms, the main bathroom, and the cupboards.   

At the end of the tenancy, Hobdays did not release our deposit within the 10-day limit as the law requires, did not give us any updates unless we chased them up persistently to get our money back, and did not take any steps to return our (full) deposit until we reminded them that withholding our deposit without a reason is unlawful. Several weeks later, they finally returned our deposit without even apologising for once again breaking the law and unnecessarily wasting our time.  

Overall, the landlords of this property and Hobdays are by far the worst we have ever had to deal with - unreliable, unempathic, irresponsible.",27-09-2022 07:35 AM,

But...
I would not recommend this property for a number of reasons.
- Huge insulation problems!
The main bedroom has no insulation at all so does not matter how long you keep the heating on, the moment when you turn it off the room starts to cool down rapidly. It is freezing cold at winter time.
The same with the bathroom.
But the biggest problem is the house has no water insulation!!! That means after every rainy day all the walls are soaking wet! After two weeks the paint came off the walls and the mould started to grow everywhere! We contacted the agency several times, but they did nothing about it! We had to use a dehumidifier and take it from room to room. It was going 24/7 to control humidity. That obviously cost us a lot of money to buy and run. No compensation whatsoever from the landlord!
And if you think that was the worst, think again.
- The worst thing we had to face there caused by the landlord himself when he decided that the easiest way to get rid of the dirty water in the kitchen is to connect the waste pipe into the rainwater highway just front of the house what is obviously illegal!! Yes, that is right! So all the tenants over the years polluted the water with everything what goes down in a kitchen sink without knowing it! 
We just realised what is going on when it blocked completely. The agency sent someone who fixed it than they sent the bill to us to pay for it! We did not pay fortunately because after that it happened again every 3 month.  A manager from the water highways tried to sort the issue out with the landlord, but he was never available. It is still an ongoing problem. 
When it blocked last time, everybody refused to clean it out, so we could not use the whole kitchen area! No washing machine, no dishwasher, nothing. And the solution? The landlord idea was to move all the machines to the back! Into one of the bedrooms!! Hey? At this point we had enough.

All in all it was a very bad experience with both the landlord and the agency. 
Every time we reported something the agency was not able to reach the landlord therefore they never sorted any problem out. I had to do everything myself. I am glad it is over now! I just wish that the law would be more powerful against these type of agencies and landlords. These kind of properties should never be rented out to humans to live in them! :-(",19-10-2017 10:53 PM,£400

To begin with, my bathroom had a mould problem in my bathroom due to a lack of ventilation or fan which I reported to the landlord in October 2019. It took months to be resolved, and I had to eventually threaten council intervention if this wasn\'t fixed. Eventually, in late February 2020 - nearly 5 months later - I was given a dehumidifier after the landlord claimed (wrongly) that they hadn\'t been made aware of the problem (she had been - five times in writing via email and WhatsApp). This was especially distressing since I have breathing issues, which were exacerbated by this problem, and I was essentially blamed for letting the problem get \'out of control\' by the landlord instead of simply being apologised to for having to put up with it for so long. There was no adequate ventilation, which is in direct contravention to the Housing Act.

Insult duly added to injury, the landlord then turfed my housemates and me out of the property in the midst of a global pandemic, citing that they needed to \'sell the property\' (when, in fact, it was promptly put back up onto the market to let at a reduced rate). They then proceeded to conjure up £2,000 worth of damages (amongst which, an extra £400 for cleaning when we paid £270 for a professional end-of-tenancy cleaning company to come in, with receipt as evidence), all of which we are currently STILL contesting through the TDPS.

In short: nice place, awful landlord. Do not rent this property if you value honesty, decency, and holding on to your money. If it\'s too good to turn down, take as many pictures as humanly possible before you even unpack a single item.",18-08-2020 08:19 AM,£2700

Large HD TV is a very nice feature of the flat, and nice views on parks and guildhall clock tower. Overall I would recommend this property, but be aware that the landlord might be particular about the way you may wish to enjoy the property. 

To prospective lodgers: remember that you will be a lodger and not a tenant. Lodgers in a live-in landlord situation do not enjoy the same rights as tenants of live-out landlord properties. As a lodger you will have to abide by the rules of the landlord, as unreasonable as they may sound to you. See below for some examples of how that might affect your stay.

 The landlord works from the living room, which is not available during the day, and sometimes also in the evenings and weekends, so be prepared to not be able to use it at your convenience. This caused a major inconvenience during my stay, especially as no reduction on rent was agreed. The landlord wasn\'t responsive to this issue despite my repeated complaints. I wouldn\'t be able to use the room even before he started working in the morning, as this would \""cause a distraction\"" to him. Use of the desk in the living room is not allowed even when the landlord is away. 

 The landlord is very concerned with keeping the property in a good state, perhaps limiting your freedom of action in the flat. For instance,  food is not allowed in the living room, or in the bedroom. Moreover, expect not being able to have friends round, which is seen as an inconvenience by the landlord even when he works from site and during daytime, as they would cause \""extra wear and tear\"". Friends in the evenings are allowed \""infrequently\"" as per the tenancy agreement (somehow that doesn\'t cause \""wear and tear\"") but expect the landlord to ask you to let them go after 11 pm (this has actually happened to me, and we were being very quiet and with the door closed. Eventually I stopped having friends over when he was there to avoid being embarrassed again by this behaviour.) By contrast, it has often happened that he would make noise after that time, including showering and cooking even at my request to stop that as I was going through a period of severe insomnia.

Partners in a long distance relationship are however welcome to stay up to a week per month, and the landlord has shown flexibility with more frequent visits, which I appreciated. He also showed respect for privacy.",04-07-2021 08:14 AM,£600

There was a 6-month break clause in the contract that she pretended to not to know about. She then tried to deny that she had received the notice. Thankfully the letting agent told me that she had lied. She also attempted to breach the tenancy fees act and demanded a professional clean. When it came to the deposit return she claimed to not know how to return it despite it being held by her in a personal bank account.

She couldn\'t move easily - or she would have- because of personal circumstances, and the fact that everywhere else in Oxford was even more unaffordable. She never once went into arrears or broke any of the terms of the tenancy. Despite her loyalty and being an extremely \'well-behaved\' tenant, the landlady was extremely reluctant to spend money on anything. The property was old and run down and hadn\'t been refurbished for years. Whenever fixtures and fittings legally needed replacing, they were reluctantly replaced with something cheaper or even older than the fixture or fitting that had broken. The property was broken into and burgled within a month of my wife renting it because of poor security. Then the landlady tried to charge my wife for putting new locks in! The washing machine broke over my wife\'s first Christmas there, but the landlady waited for three weeks to fix it (leaving my wife having to use a launderette while she had a 6 year old and very young baby) because the landlady wanted to get it fixed on the final two months of its ten year guarantee. The repairman deemed it unfixable after all that, and the landlady replaced with a 6 year old machine, which almost instantly broke. Once, during a storm, a whole top window fell out of the external wall, including the rotten frame, on to the pavement below. Luckily nobody was walking below at that minute or they would have been seriously injured or killed. It was left boarded up for a month while the landlady argued with her insurers. The fence then collapsed.Again, it was left like that for about two months, because of more  arguments between t he landlady and her insurers. Then half the the liviing room ceiling collapsed due to the unsealed tiles in the bathroom  overhead leaking water into the walls. The landlady then made me and my wife pay out of  our own pockets for a hotel room for  a week while it was all fixed. There were countless other issues. All of the landlady\'s bad behaviour was supported by the estate agents, who were rude and patronising and even aggressive at all times about getting 
 anything  fixed, as if it was our fault - even though we were paying £1150 pcm for this two up-two down  property! (,I found out, was formerly a pig sty- for real!)

I\'m just in the middle of moving out of this property with one of my housemates and we have both decided to leave as a consequence of the landlord\'s toxic behavior and unfair house rules. 

On arrival, the house was very clean and remained that way throughout my stay but I didn\'t realise that this was as a result of his stringent and obsessive cleaning. In our group chat, we received sometimes up to 5 messages per day including pictures of minute spots of dirt and passive-aggressive messages stating that it was our obligation to keep the house to his standards. He used his housemate who he states is his \'best friend\' as a leverage point to guilt-trip us into cleaning, stating that his friend was always complaining about the house (which he wasn\'t as he never mentioned anything to me and when I asked him if there were any issues he didn\'t have any)! 

Another example of the unusual rules can be displayed in a scenario that happened last week. There were repairs going on in the middle bathroom (which me and my housemate use) and we were informed by the Plumber that we were to not use it for 24 hours. There\'s a second bathroom upstairs and we asked to use it but he wouldn\'t allow us to use the bathroom for just one day. He wouldn\'t explain why and only gave an obscure and heated response when he shouted at me and stated that its his bathroom and he keeps it pristine and to his standards. 

I can only describe my experience in this property as negative as I felt as if I was in a hotel rather than a house. I mostly stayed in my room and kitchen as I wouldn\'t feel comfortable anywhere else. There wasn\'t one day where there wasn\'t a complaint from him regarding a switch, crumb stain or threat to evict us.

Last month he decided to increase the rent by £100 extra PCM because in his words he was undergoing \'financial issues\'. In light of this unprofessionalism, he did not grant me a new agreement and has stated that I owe him £110 for the last week of stay. I implore this landlord to rethink his understanding of what lodgers\' rights are and to understand that other lodgers have their own lives and cannot feel as though they are under the radar 24/7. 

To top it all off he has decided to install cameras into the property in the front room, kitchen and hallway as he spotted me cleaning my shoes with the door open for 1 minute and confronted me in a passive-aggressive tone. At most times I felt confronted and very uncomfortable. 

I would not suggest staying here and stay well away from this landlord\'s next property viewing.",02-03-2021 03:58 PM,£345

I can vouch for the pub. Excellent food and nice atmosphere.
Waggoners Farm Barn,  we were there for 18 months and it’s probably the worst place we’ve ever stayed in. Having come from a converted barn, we are used to old buildings with their individual problems but this thing is something else. The roof leaked in a number of places due to holes and rotten Velux windows which the landlord continually patched up rather than replace. However the worst one is above the bedroom which is caused by the poor installation of solar panels and it leaks in directly above where the bed would go, so it’s a good idea to wear waterproofs when you go to bed and it’s raining. The panels would have to be removed and re fitted I was told to get to the problem.
Virtually all the windows are rotten and the glazing blown, the inside has loose electrical wires that have been taped up. All the carpets are worn, tatty and stained. Be careful  as the landlord tried to blame us for this. The only thing that saved us was the inventory which showed the original condition.
If you rent, don’t expect anything to be done quickly.  When the alarm failed due to getting soaked by a leaking wall, The landlord pleaded poverty to us saying he couldn\'t afford to get it repaired.
The garage door doesn’t work properly and the stop cock freezes in the winter as the insulation in the garage where it is, is virtually none existent.
Then the central heating. The boiler is antiquated and will stay on 24/7 when the temperature drops, burning your very expensive heating oil. You cannot turn it off as the garage ambient temperature can drop to freezing.
The large room at the back is serviced by two cast iron radiators that are in-effective and a small log burner. You may as well light a candle for all the good that does. We had to vacate the room from November to May as it was impossible to heat. And the radiators are separate from the main heating system so are on all the time, not that it makes any difference to the temp.
When we were there, the Aga didn’t work properly and was on maximum all the time and you could not adjust the temperature. The engineer refused to come back out because, in his words,  the landlord took weeks to pay their last bill.  This is also a real pain because in the summer you cannot turn it off as you have no alternative means of cooking, so you bake.
The back bathroom smells from the drains from time to time
It is very noisy being in the main road as you would expect
If you were to rent this, expect to refill the oil tank at least once every two months at a current cost of about £1000
If you are thinking of buying it, get a full structural survey done. We were told by trades men it probably needs £150,000 spending on it to get it to a decent standard and for that you could buy a house in a much nicer condition and in a far quieter, nicer location.
I believe the owners described it as a palace to the letting agents.  You can judge for yourself, but I would say a dilapidated shack would be more accurate and decorated to a cheap and tacky standard in our opinion.",04-09-2022 11:36 AM,£2000

I rented the residence through a lettings agent, the landlord seemed a nice old lady (which was important as she was living within 10 feet of me), but once everything was signed and I was on her hook, she turned into a volatile, aggressive stalker.
I was not allowed to park my car on the driveway I was paying for unless I reversed in, I wasn\'t allowed to park with the back end of my car facing the street. There are no reason given for this demand.
I wasn\'t always allowed to use the parking spot I was paying for as the landlord liked to use the space for repotting their plants.
There was a leak in the bathroom taps when I first moved in, I was told this would be sorted, but I\'ve moved out and the leak is still going strong, it has added to my water bill and wasn\'t even my fault to fix.
I was told when to turn my lights out at night, and if I didn\'t, there is a switch on the outside of the house which the landlord would use to switch off my lights whether I wanted them off or not!
I discovered there were lots of rats and mice within the property when I first moved in, but instead of paying an exterminator, I was told the property is old and the walls have cavities which mice and rats like to live in, so I could set my own traps if I wanted. Nothing more was ever done.
When I first moved in I was told I was not allowed to move the landlord\'s two rugs within the property, despite them smelling foul. Once day I rolled up one of the rugs and stored it safely away and hours later I got a text demanding to know where the other rug was. The landlord can\'t even see into the property without entering it so this left me confused and scared.
There were also massive cracks in the walls and gaps in all the window sills which allowed hornets, insects and even birds into the property, which the landlord refused to do anything about.
I enquired about getting my own bins as I paid council tax and required my own, but the landlord forced me to share hers and shouted at me down the phone one day when I asked, forbidding me getting my own bins as she didn\'t want any extra on the property. This led to the council finding out she never put through planning permission on my residence. I pleaded with the lettings agent to let me out of the tenancy contract as it should have been void after the property was found to be illegal, but they refused.
Due to the stalking and harassment on a daily basis from the landlord I had to seek mental health help.
I have just moved out over a month early which has cost me direly, and the landlord has demanded a lot of illegal things of me since I had given her my notice, including sending me bills which I have no idea what they\'re for, and billing me for things that aren\'t in my contract. Again, I\'ve tried getting help from the lettings agent, but they feel they have no duty of care to me as they are making money off the landlord.",03-10-2022 12:24 PM,£725

It was a lodger situation but the complete lack of regard for someone else\'s privacy and property was horrendous - privacy and autonomy were non-existent. 

The landlord walked into my bedroom without knocking while I was in bed and then stood in the doorway, and said they weren\'t expecting me to be at home and in my bed. They then proceeded to walk further into the room to look for something (though why they thought one of their possessions was in my room I don\'t know) and only stepped out when I asked them to because again, I was in bed in a state of undress and needed to put on a dressing gown. In the hallway, the landlord acted like I was insane for being uncomfortable with the situation and when I tried to bring it up later they would not agree to knock before entering the room. I was left extremely uncomfortable and never knew when they\'d walk in unannounced again (the room had no lock). 
Similarly, the bathroom door actually had a lock on it but the landlord would try to open the door, discover it locked, then continue trying to open the door which felt very threatening. 

This is a hygiene issue - the landlord would go to the toilet in the middle of the night and would not shut the door while they were on the toilet and then they wouldn\'t flush! Every morning I would have to see their urine in the toilet, which is completely inappropriate when you\'re choosing to rent a room in your home. Flush the toilet, it\'s simple. 

Not only was sleep difficult due to an incessant tapping sound at night (presumably due to the heating that is always on though never in the rented bedroom), but it was also absolutely freezing in the room. The landlord did explain the heating (though their understanding was limited) but, despite having never changing it myself, sent me accusatory messages about how expensive the heating bill was, seemingly unaware of the global heating crisis. 

The landlord went away on a trip and had their friends staying which was mostly fine but the landlord had obviously told them to help themselves to anything which meant that it was exclusively my food that was eaten without my permission, it was not replaced. 

The landlord was very intrusive in my life, I brought my belongings into the home and into my room and the landlord insisted on commenting on my possessions (which I now assume is because they were in my room and going through my things to \""look for something\""). They also tried to get me to throw stuff away. This was a personal thing, but I think a lodger is just as entitled to their privacy. 

The rental was advertised as a bedroom in a home with a SHARED kitchen, living room, dining room, bathrooms and parking. There was no private parking or parking outside the house (despite it being a feature in the ad). The landlord also does not like people owning cars (and yet exclusively takes Ubers or taxis) so lectured me frequently about having a car - my only way to get to work. 
The living room was not shared. I used it once and the landlord got angry at me for sitting on the sofa so I had to spend all of my time in my room. The kitchen was shared but I got a tiny shelf in a cupboard, a shelf in the fridge and no freezer space. I was able to cook in the kitchen by myself once, otherwise the landlord would be in there lecturing me. I wasn\'t able to use the dining room either. 

The landlord accused me of stealing packages and mail (it was then delivered a few days later). And then when I couldn\'t find one of my packages it turned out that they had seen it earlier in the week, assumed it was for them (they hadn\'t ordered anything and it had my name on it) and took it for themselves!

Finally, the landlord looked after someone\'s cat and, when I wasn\'t there, they would open the door to my room for the cat to climb over my bed (there were dirty paw prints all over the sheets) and go through my belongings. Again, total lack of regard for my possessions or privacy. 

In summary, this room was far too expensive for what was offered and I felt violated my entire time there.",24-01-2023 10:08 AM,£700

There are BEDBUGS in the property, he tried to fix the problem several times but without great success, they will bite you every night.
Very noisy, the insulation of the room is very poor, so you hear your roommates and neighbors on the upper floor. Even if your roommates speak not very loud you cannot sleep because you hear them clearly.

This landlord invented the rule that each room must clear the whole property twice per week. Toilet, kitchen, common areas etc.
Why not 3 or 4 times per week? This is totally unacceptable behavior because the property was in a reasonable good condition, we (tenants) were looking after it.

The toilet was constantly clogged because it was not properly connected to the sewage, as a result, there were constant blockages and you just couldn\'t wash it off, all sewage was floating and does not go away, you needed to clean it all the time. Even if cleaned, the next time it becomes clogged again.

The overall landlord\'s behavior I can describe as arrogant, you feel yourself like he is doing you a favor by renting out the poor quality rooms, probably he forgot that we are paying him the money, not vice versa.

The heating system does not work properly - it involves lighting a match and trying to find the pilot light under the boiler.

The heating system is also not efficient in the slightest - the bedroom part heats up a lot, whilst downstairs barely heats up at all. However, the main problem as the other review points out is the noise - trains come past the flat all day/night, and unfortunately due to a nearby level crossing always horn just as they go past. This makes sleep/relaxing difficult.
The other main problem came in regards to our deposit. Shortly before the end of the tenancy, there was a noticeable change in attitude over emails from the landlord. The landlord then attempted to retain £100 for carpet/oven/wall cleaning at the end of the tenancy.  We strongly objected to this - both in terms of the amount and the fact that any extra cleaning was needed at all. The landlord was very unwilling to come to a fair agreement, and unfortunately we had to use the Deposit dispute process. Fortunately, having picked up the Landlord\'s change in attitude, I managed to take photos of most areas of the flat during check-out to prove the condition that it was left in.

the circumstances and more proportionate to the Tenant’s liability so, bearing in mind the
Landlord has already retained £190.00, I award the Landlord the remaining difference of
£100.00.

The main downside to this property is the landlord - she is nitpicky at best and intrusive at worst. She is extremely particular about her property, insisting on professional cleans before the tenancy starts \'as a courtesy to the incoming tenants\' - except that of course she takes £300 out of your deposit when you leave. She is neurotic and when we discovered an awful cockroach infestation in the property within a month or so of moving there, she passively aggressively suggested that we had caused this, despite the fact that there were full-grown cockroaches and so many of them that it was impossible to have started less than two months ago. We had to calm her down as she was very stressed by the cockroaches even though we had to live with it, and berated us for not cleaning crumbs from under the toaster. This is also after she complimented us on how clean the flat is when she comes round. She went for a cheaper option to get rid of the bugs which ultimately didn\'t work, and so we actually had to move out for five weeks while the house was fumigated. She \'kindly\' didn\'t charge us rent for those five weeks that we were unable to live there and only properly fumigated the house when we put our foot down to say that the flat is uninhabitable - there were cockroaches in every room of the house at this point. When we gave notice to leave after a year, she voiced her disappointment, only to come round before we had even moved out to measure blinds and curtains, as well as point out minor scuffs on the wall, ask us to hoover the mattress and insist that everything was put back exactly as it was when we moved in (an ugly mirror on the dresser, the paintings back exactly in the right place on the wall etc). She made us feel so uncomfortable that we actually left the property while she remained to do more checks (?) - again, this is BEFORE our tenancy had finished. Luckily we had already moved to our new property as the tenancies overlapped. Overall, I would say it\'s a shame that the property has such an invasive landlord, as the flat itself is lovely (sans cockroaches, which was solved eventually) and we were really looking forward to living in our first home together as a couple. Unfortunately, it was tainted by a £300 deduction from our deposit for a professional clean, which altogether was ironic given her house was full of bugs and we kept it impeccably clean. In short, would not recommend at all if you want to keep your sanity.",25-08-2023 05:31 AM,£1550

Over many years of renting with them they have rapidly decreased in standard of service and speed in getting things repaired. The landlord is focused only on getting money and not about the people living in his multiple properties. They have put a homeless person in our flat as the legally cant rent it out as the room is too small but now they get an income. The flat smells of urine since the new guy moved in and the landlord is not doing much about it. He needed to make a room bigger and so he broke through one of the bedrooms walls and decreased the size of that room to increase the size of the other. They won’t give a reference 7ntil you give your notice to leave and they overcharge for any damage eg( small stain on bed and they wanted £200). The other tenant had to contact DPS to make sure they didn’t get away with it. In the end it was only a £30 charge. The will try take your whole deposit from you through outrageous charges. They have also tried to charge every tennant £20-£30 a month extra to have a barely acceptable cleaner in. I would just avoid this company as the stress and financial loss is not worth it.,02-04-2018 04:41 PM,£780

The house was poorly insulated, with old leaky windows, had a strange mixture of a wooden (half-rotting) and cement floor in the kitchen, and window in the living room could not be opened leaving the air stale. 

At least two of the bedrooms had serious mould issues.

Negative elements - cold, damp and mouldy, most windows have no functioning seals and are draughty - this makes the property very expensive to heat - fixes were promised but never materialised. Very old kitchen in very poor state with painted tiles that flake all the time. Very poor carpets throughout with no underlay, again adding to the heating expense. Conservatory leaks very badly and is unusable, water ingress to the room adjoining the conservatory. Downstairs toilet is cold, damp and mouldy. Large garden is very difficult and time consuming to maintain as the landlord offers no assistance or tools.

The 4 tenants 3 females and one male were nothing but nasty to me while living in the property. One girl banged on my door at 3 am accusing me of keeping her awake. I called the police as I was afraid for my safety as I only just moved in and was not sure what she was capable of. The police did not turn up at all they said if she disturbed me again to call them. I reported the incident to the agent and the agent who is a woman did nothing about it. All she did was agree I was making noise and dismissed my feelings I expressed to her that I felt afraid. She showed no remorse or anything. I told her I reported the tenant to the police. The next day the female tenant was complaining about me to the two female tenants. I could hear her repeating the things I said to the agent via email. Therefore the agent set the female tenant on me and does not know anything about confidentiality. 

This female tenant the next day after called the police and told the police that I tried to stab her. I was so shocked and in disbelief. The police could work out the female tenant was lying that banged on my door at 3am and told her she was wrong. I told the agent in my email when I complained about the female tenant banging on my door for her to tell the tenant not to knock on my door again but the harassment continued. The other three tenants then started banging on my door. They made my life a living hell. 

Also, 2 months after I moved in the agent threatened to send me a section 8 just because my ex called the cops to my house to accuse me of harassment (which was not true) it was my ex that couldn\'t handle me breaking it off with him). The tenants are the ones that called the agent when the cops came the agent did not even listen to me why they came over. She made me feel so intimidated. 

I then had my mental health affected over the months because of the tenants and agent. I had to go to the council and get a Case Worker to contact the Landlord to investigate the agent and the tenants. But the Landlord did nothing they ignored my cries of suffering. I really believe the agent is biased and the tenants are racist. 

I went to court this July as the Landlord applied to court without notice to me and my solicitor and I was able to suspend the possession order. I have no job and can\'t even move out so will have to see if the council now can step in to help me with permanent housing before I end up homeless. I don\'t know what the outcome will be by the end of the month, but it is scary how people can get away with destroying your life and trying to character assassinate you.

Easy access to public transport and local school. Nice area didn’t come across any trouble in the area. Landlord used a letting agency however the landlord himself was exceptional. I had an issue where my bathroom was flooded. As I was a downstairs tenant there was a blockage in the sewage pipes and therefore every time upstairs flushed their toilet or had a shower it was coming up through my toilet. Bathroom got completely flooded and was disgusting. The landlord personally came out to the property to deal with the situation. He brought his own towels and cleaning products to help so that I wasn’t using my own to clean up the mess. He stayed at the property until the issue was resolved and personally got in touch with people he needed to to get it sorted. I couldn’t have been any more grateful for him and his help. Great guy and great landlord! We need more landlords like him!,05-02-2022 10:58 AM,£430

First of all the landlord is not someone you want to be dealing with. He will do the less when it comes to repair and is unfairly trying to claim my full deposit back. I just don\'t think he is someone fair and square. The lack of assistance from the landlord was to say the least unimaginable. I asked so may times for small repairs that needed to be done but he just never cared. 

The good think about the property is probably the view. The location isn\'t great since its far from big supermarkets. Close to Queenspark though. I don\'t think the price asked is worth it. I found cheaper bigger and better as I just moved somewhere else. The property is furnished, The bed is comfortable enough and the storage in the bedroom is big. The couch in the living room and the desk chair are horribly uncomfortable. They should be replaced, which I asked for so may times, but the landlords never agreed to that. Again, his lack of flexibility speaks for itself. 

When I moved in, the first night, there was a leak from the ceiling in the bedroom that stained my duvet! I could not use electricity during a couple of days for the leak to dry. It was cold and could not use the heater and I had to sleep in the living room. I have been reimbursed one night from the landlord.... a proof of his human kindness.  The leak stained the ceiling. The ceiling has never been painted during my two years at the property despite my numerous email to the letting agency that was Fox and Son while I was staying there. I suppose this will be fix at some point for the next tenant. The lack of response is again one fo those example of people not caring from both the agency and the lanlord. 

There is a mould issue in the porch. This is due to humidity. it\'s pretty bad. This has never been fixed. This is a building/property issue. The isolation from the windows is not the best either and relates to the humidity issue.  

The bathroom has no ventilation system and no plug socket!!! The water pressure is not the best but manageable. The bathtub has a leak inside but the landlord never changed the piece that caused it because its just one expensive bit to change. This caused my bathtub to always have the side panel unfitted and open so the worker who used to come to do some maintenance work could do some sort of hack and access it fast. Again, things not done properly. This worker stopped working for the landlord as he had enough of being unreasonably  annoyed by him. 

The apartment has carpet and that is ok but it will need some professional work to be cleaned. In terms of heat the heating works well. Electricity is fine. The plants come with the apartment you have to deal with them else the landlord will make you pay for them.  

The place is not that sunny but not that dark. I wanted more sun so this one was of the reason why I moved. It gets dark very fast as the apartment is not facing west. The kitchen has everything needed. 

Big moth INFESTATION during spring and summer. I never had moth before. They come specially when the weather gets warm. You can even see them in the hallway of the property. I think it\'s a building issue. 

THE WORST OF THIS PROPERTY:

A DRUG LORD LIVES ON THE SECOND FLOOR. THIS WILL DISTURB YOUR NIGHTS AND TAKE YOUR SANITY AWAY. 

The drug lord has people coming in and out all the time. We had to create a case with the police and the council to have notice of closure. But it seems he just repeats patterns. He will be quiet for a while and then it ss another go to the party. Noises during the night, fights, screams, strangers, blood, urine and needles in the staircase. I have seen girls having overdoses or being unconscious in the grass outside the property.  I had contacted the agency about it and got no answer what\'s so ever from Fox and Sons or the landlord as they just didn\'t care at all. If you need a quiet place to live, just don\'t bother with this one and do yourself some good. 

I was paying 900 but the landlords raised the property to 925. That was also one of the reason why I moved. The property is worth 850 per month max really. I accepted it because I was desperate for a flat at that time. 

If you have a car its a hit or miss for parking. The street is on a slope, narrow and  has traffic all day. I didn\'t have a car and I am happy I didn\'t. 

Happy to be contacted if more info are needed . 
Cheers

The landlord doesnt repair things correctly, he always has to be here when a gas engineer or plumber comes for repairs and wont let them fix it properly E.g Hot tap on the bath was loose, you had to hold the tap to turn it on or off. Instead of letting the plumber take a tile off the side of the bath to tighten the tap he told me that i would have to just keep holding the tap to turn it on or off, i told him the tap gets hot bus was called a liar until he tested it himself.
The landlord turns up as and when he pleases, uses the excuse that he was next door so thought he would pop in. 
Ive had his sister in law demanding to get in the house and because i wouldnt let her she started to record through my patio doors so i had to shut my curtains. I told her she wasnt allowed. Ive had to call the police as they will not remove themselves when they turn up unannounced. 
They havent secured my deposit....twice...they didnt give me the energy performance certificate when i asked for it, i had to remind them twice. 
The boiler was infact wired up incorrectly which the engineer and the landlord tried claiming on the warranty which is illegal. This is fraud. The day my boiler blew i complained about the wiring,  Now the landlord is lying about it saying it wasnt wired up incorrectly but i video recorded the engineer telling him so. 
They have just been underhand, dodgy in every way shape or form and im not the first person for this to happen to as he was the same with another single mother.",31-05-2016 11:46 AM,£0

I always have to hold my breathe when I go out of or come back into my apartment. The smell comes into your apartment in the Summer, and there are constantly 4-5 flies flying in at any time.

Liked the place so much that I ended up staying for two years. 

Never had any problems with plumbing, electricity or structure of the property, although slight mould build-up around the windows in the winter. Gas heating system was very efficient and kept the place nice and warm in the winter. 

Apartment is well-lit throughout the day. Unfortunately this was occasionally an issue as no curtains/curtain rails were provided and instead the flat comes with basic blinds that do little to block out the light when you are trying to sleep (more of an issue during summer months, naturally).

Was not given induction by landlord, check-in was performed by a ‘check-in agent’ who, despite being friendly enough, did not know much about the flat or where anything was.  

On-street parking available, although spaces can be hard to find if arriving home late in the day. 

Traffic on road outside can be fairly loud and intrusive but if you’re used to living in a city it probably will not bother you. 

On very rare occasion that property has required repairs the landlord’s agents were quick to send around their handy-man – a lovely bloke who prides himself on attention to detail – and as a result most issues were resolved very promptly (although on occasion the agent may need reminding)

Neighbours are generally very friendly and quiet, although we were very rarely (<5 times in two years) disturbed by residents in the social housing block of flats a few doors down when they had parties/domestic disputes. 

Only real issue with the property is how thin the floors are – I lived alone as did my downstairs neighbour and as a result neither of us made that much noise. However, being an old, converted house, I could unfortunately hear much of what was going on downstairs e.g. talking, doors closing, even coughs and sneezes, and I don’t doubt my neighbour would have been able to hear me upstairs too. If either property had particularly loud people living there I’m sure this would significantly impact on the neighbour’s enjoyment of their flat.  

Sadly in the last month of the tenancy I had an unexpected altercation with the landlord. Throughout the two-year tenancy the property had been managed by an ‘agent’ who, owing to them both having the same last name, was clearly the landlord’s daughter. Throughout the tenancy she was fairly incompetent and unreliable but owing to the fact she was quite young and that she would, with enough prompting, get issues sorted eventually this did not pose too much of a problem. However at the end of the tenancy, when she began arranging viewings for prospective tenants, her lackadaisical approach meant that she invariable arranged viewings with less than 24 hours’ notice. This was not a big problem until, one weekend, she contacted me at 5:30pm on a Saturday to let me know she had booked no less than ten separate viewings for Sunday at 12pm. As I had friends coming over for a party I replied saying that this was not appropriate and that she should reschedule. The agent did not think to check her emails until 10:30 on the Sunday and when she did she became hysterical; she called me immediately and let loose with a torrent of abuse before alternating between threatening me with litigation and pleading to my better nature. When that did not move me, she went crying to her father, the landlord, who then called me and threatened to come to the property, let himself in and attack me unless I backed-down and let his daughter show the tenants around. Sadly, faced with the prospect of at best having to fight a middle-aged man, or at worst have to fight a lengthy court case to get my deposit back, I acquiesced and asked my friends to go down to the pub while the viewings went ahead. 

As a result, as much as I enjoyed my time in the property I could never recommend renting anything from this pair of self-important sociopaths. If you do end up renting from them, be prepared to deal with a petulant and emotionally unstable child of an agent and a violent, unhinged landlord.",28-08-2019 06:39 AM,£925

It is approached through a partially blocked (with refuse) covered passageway from the High Street, you then pass the bin area which is often very smelly, before reaching the main door, which is loose and features an inadequate lock.

THE entire left side of the flat has damp coming through the walls, causing the wallpaper to peel off and rendering one of the bedrooms un useable for purpose. Mold is a real problem.

The floor carpets are filthy and very old.

On arrival there was no doorbell (essential for this property), no bathroom mirror or blinds on bathroom window.  All of these I had to buy and fit myself.


The landlord was very difficult to contact by phone, email or any other method.

When there was no heating in February (resulting from a fault with the heater) she was at first almost impossible to contact.  Then very reluctant to engage with the problem at all.  Eventually it was over three weeks without heating before it was fixed.

On moving out of the property I asked if she would like me to leave behind the new wasing machine and desk I had brought to the property , for the next tenant to benefit from.  She agreed.
However, after vacating she entirely changed her mind and requested that I remove these items – I chose to have the cost of this deducted from my returned deposit as I had by this time moved on and couldn\'t personally deal with it.

This was symptomatic of the general unreliability of this landlord throughout my tenancy.

When I moved into my flat there was mould in the kitchen and bathroom, the oven didn\'t work, the washing machine didn\'t work, the paint was wet on the walls, blood stains on the mattresses, doors hanging off hinges, the furniture deteriorating, everything smelt of mildew. At no point did I receive a discount for the faulty appliances or state of disrepair, nor one during the global pandemic.

After 3.5 years, where every maintenance issue was bodged, a seemingly bogus EICR report made, various serious fire safety issues, a complete indifference from the agents to the wellbeing of the tenant, and Enfields upping the rent I decided enough was enough.

They then lied to me about the end of tenancy process, saying I had to move out at the end of the rental month (it was actually simply 1 month after the day I gave notice), then despite requests for the check-out, they sent me no details about deductions or the check-out report.

After weeks of nothing, I had to pay a solicitor to witness a statutory declaration form to force them to send the details. They eventually sent them 6 weeks after the end of the tenancy, a day before it would have been returned, and 15 days past the deadline for deductions as written in the tenancy agreement (clause 6.5).

And to top it off, they then went on to claim £1300 (more than the deposit) worth of clearly unsubstantiated deductions, things clearly shown to have been defective in the check-in, which was made 3.5 years ago!

It is bright and spacious. It is however in a poor condition that requires major renovation. The walls and the roof leak when it rains, which results in the mould forming inside. Despite this issue being fixed to some extent last year, it still persists. The kitchen is dated, fridge accumulates ice, furniture and the oven were damaged from first day we rented it, and it was never fixed. Also, there is a problem with spiders. There are hordes of them on the ground floor, as there are many uninsulated gaps and corners in the kitchen where they hide. The spider problem has never been addressed by the agency either, in spite of reporting.
The fuse box is also very old, sometimes causing problems with electricity.
Although the landlord replaced most of old windows and initially absolutely unsecure and faulty doors, windows on the top floor are still the same, with one window being broken. It cannot be closed properly which causes drafts and occasional leakage.
The agency has been fairly responsive to reports but only to fix essential issues, such as clogged drains. It however took a long time and usually many reminders to get things fixed, e.g. it took four months to fix a leaking wall. 
In the end of tenancy, the landlord claimed the entire deposit. While one charge was agreed upon, the rest were for repairs for damages that we did not make. Given that we bought many things for the house that we left there (vacuum cleaners, bookshelves, desks that were essential and improved its value), inventing reasons for deductions is absolutely repulsive.
The house has a lot of potential to become a really great place if renovated. However, in its current condition, it might not be the best option to rent.",15-07-2020 11:38 AM,£975

The flat itself was pretty bad. Single pane windows overlooking a very busy road. Lots of pubs nearby so drunken fighting was regular into late hours. Keeping warm was an issue. Damp and mould almost everywhere. But by far, the biggest problem with this property was the landlord, who is also the managing director of the letting agent office below. And these are the reasons why:
1. A month after we moved in, they wrote to us (IMAGE #1) advising that they would obtain entry for an inspection between the hours of 1pm - 5pm on the 8th Jan 2015, and if they hadn\'t heard from us to the contrary, would \""bring their set of keys\"" in case we were not in. This clearly amounts to entry without consent. Agents were acting on behalf of landlord, who was also their boss.
2. Having signed for a six-month fixed term, we were contacted by letter (IMAGE #2) and asked to confirm our intentions at the six month point. The relevant charges were all laid out, except one that had NOT been drawn to our attention prior to the signing of the tenancy. We had guarantors for whom we had to pay £80+VAT x2 (credit checks) and we also had to pay £80+VAT x2 for each of us as tenants (credit checks) - but landlord/managing director ALSO sprung on us a further £80+VAT for \""rent guarantee insurance to guarantee the rent.\"" Which - as well as not being made aware of at start - is precisely what the guarantors do, and what we paid £80+VAT x2 to accomplish..!
3. Before we moved in, the landlord informed us that our gas bill was a shared bill...shared with the lettings office. They stated that they paid 60% of the bill and we had to pay 40%. They gave us NO further information. They way it was presented was misleading, because we thought we had struck a fair deal. But it was far from fair. When the first quarterly bill arrived (IMAGE #3), the landlord had calculated each percentage and dropped a note through the door demanding we pay £518 for three months gas (IMAGE #4). Although the flat was a six bedroom property, the top floor - consequently three rooms - had no heating at all. Not only that, but all hot water was done via the immersion heater - therefore, from our pre-paid electricity. What we found out, was that the bill - totalling £1,296 - was in fact a business account bill which incurred a much higher rate of VAT. Not only were the office bound by Health and Safety Laws to keep the office space continually heated throughout the winter, but the rates were not the same as domestic gas use, and domestic gas would not have incurred the same VAT. This - I felt - was information which was not only absolutely crucial to the fundamental agreement to share the gas bill, but which had been withheld from us when making the agreement. The Property Ombudsman Codes of Practice in fact place a very strict requirement on agents to disclose all relevant information like this when making agreements. It has - arguably - the effect of rendering the term a Statutorily Unfair one. 
As each of these issues occurred, I\'d made a complaint. After complaining about the final matter - the gas bill - the landlord evicted us. She later claimed she evicted us because I\'d been abusive. The Council found in her favour, and concluded we were \""intentionally homeless\"" despite the utter lack of evidence from the landlord to substantiate her claims...In fact, all the letters and emails I supplied to the council clearly showed that the landlord evicted us as a direct result of my three complaints. 
I would never, ever recommend this place to ANYONE.",02-06-2016 05:20 AM,£675

First, this place gets cold. The letting agent won\'t make this clear when showing you round, but none of the gas fires are connected, and the landlord is not willing to pay for the necessary work to make them functional. There\'s a single boiler - most properties in this area have two - which really needs to be left on all day in the winter to maintain acceptable temperatures. The windows are single-glazed, and a roaring wind comes in the back of the house. Our energy bills were enormous - around £300 on heat and light per month in the winter. I don\'t recall a single warm evening in the winter, despite that.

Second, the plumbing is very basic. The water system can supply only one tap/toilet/appliance at a time - so if you\'re taking a shower, and the washing machine is on, or if someone fills the kettle, or runs a bathroom sink downstairs, brace for the water just to.... stop. On a cold morning, that starts to grate very quickly. It takes a good while to fill a bath.

Third, the whole place is very tired, and no more so than in the kitchen. The oven\'s baffling, the grill doesn\'t work, the enormous electric hob makes annoying beeping sounds if you look at it the wrong way and the scuffed work surfaces will never ever look clean. Elsewhere, the peeling and stained wallpaper doesn\'t look great, and wall-to-wall beige carpets are a pain when you have a young family. 

Finally, Belvoir are your typical letting agents; just about competent in sorting out the mandatory swift fixes (the boiler broke down a couple of times and got sorted quickly) but slow on the rest, and occasionally rude and patronising along the way. Check the inventories carefully - don\'t let them get away with not recording pre-existing stains, marks and damage, because our outgoing inventory seemed a lot more stringent than the incoming one (although we made it clear we had plenty of photographic evidence, and got nearly all our deposit back). And don\'t let them charge you the repair fees for things that should have been fixed by the landlord!

After such a terrible experience of renting with X1 Lettings I would like to inform others of what I have experienced in order to prevent further people being ripped off and left frustrated and angry by this letting agency. Whilst staying in one of their studio apartments between 09/19-/03/20 I experienced a number of issues from day one of moving in. Here I have only highlighted the main ones. 

When I first arrived to the flat it was dirty, with hairs and crumbs in the kitchen drawers and drawers under the bed (p.1). There was food waste in the drainage part of the dishwasher (p.2) and both the fridge and oven were greasy and grimy. Clearly the flat had not been cleaned, never mind professionally cleaned. But this wasn’t a huge problem for me. The problem is that they had they cheek to make the following deductions at the end of my tenancy, after I had spent all day making the apartment spotless:

-	x2 extractor bulbs - £20 (Lights I never used…)
-	mattress clean - £35 (A mattress that had a mattress protector on it…)
-	chair clean - £35 (A chair that was dirty when I arrived and couldn’t be properly cleaned…)

After emailing back and forth I managed to get out of the first two deductions but had to settle on paying for the chair clean (I doubt it was or ever will be cleaned). And that’s not all. After spending the whole winter in that flat I noticed there were gaps in one of the windows. One between the window frame and the pane of glass, over 1cm (p.3). And the other between the two sliding window frames (p.4). These gaps were allowing cold air to fill the room and consequently I could hear every sound from outside. I had essentially wasted money on heating that went straight out the window: the one radiator in the studio was below the windows. My complaint about the window was not taken seriously by staff at X1 Lettings so I contacted Salford council instead. The council were very helpful and informed me that they deal with a lot of complaints about the apartments in this building. They presumably spoke with X1 Lettings, urging them to do something about it as it was immediately dealt with after the council’s inspection. One of the gaps was sealed with silicone whilst the other one was not seen as a major problem, for some reason I cannot understand. I received no apology or reimbursement from X1 Lettings and gave up trying to fully resolve this issue. 

The fact they allowed a tenant to move into a dirty flat with broken windows shows how negligent and unprofessional this rental agency is. Making unnecessary deductions from deposits further emphasises their greed and complete disregard for their tenants. If you are looking to rent with this agency, I would advise you to not rent an apartment in Town Hall. You will have problem after problem. The building is falling to bits and they have made a have hearted attempt to create rental apartments within this building. The apartments are cheap and nasty – inefficient heating, extreme condensation and mould (p.5). If you have a problem that needs fixed, it will be swept aside and never dealt with. I cannot speak for their other properties, but I would advise anyone to avoid renting with X1 Lettings. In my experience the staff are rude, dismissive and unsympathetic.",10-09-2020 10:25 AM,£650

This is a house share of 5 tenants. They share kitchen facilities only as the bedroom rooms are double en suites. 

However since then it’s been a nightmare of a tenancy. This is a HMO (house of multiple occupancy). He is a live out landlord who lives 3 hours away in Birmingham . No property management company involved. He has a PA in the Philippines and one contracted handyman. 

A previous tenant didn’t pay rent, he harassed him and the landlord asked tenants to spy on him, cut off his water supply, cut off his internet access  and join in harassing him, to which the tenants declined. He even asked one other tenant to open his mail (which the tenant declined!!). 

2) Builders kept turning up to paint rooms with zero notice, therefore disturbing the peace. Also he books viewings for other empty rooms with zero notice and people keep turning up to view with zero warning. 

3) One of the rings on the hob broke, the law states in a HMO 4 rings must work per 5 occupants. Reported it and it took over a month to be fixed. 

4) In October the water stopped working entirely for a day due to a broken pipe outside. Landlord was texted when it happened (sadly was at 10pm, but we couldn’t shower, flush toilets or get a drink as shops were closed already) and the landlord was not sympathetic and just sent us dramatic texts like ‘be thankful you don’t have an infection people have it worse!!!’. Luckily it got sorted the next morning. 

5) Landlord harasses female tenants. Asks them constantly out for dinner/lunch dates and makes inappropriate comments about their appearance.

6) The landlord keeps asking current tenants to take previous tenants items to the bin and the tip, but they’re his legal responsibility.

7) A letter came to all occupants stating a warrant was issued to search the property. The council turned up a few weeks later and said our landlord has no HMO licence, he applied 2.5 years ago and never continued with it, he’s been on their radar for months. This is a criminal offence. 

8 ) When tenants move out he makes excuses to not pay the deposits back and the law states 10 days. Also sometimes he doesn’t put some people’s deposits in the deposit protection scheme (one person for 3 months!) and the law is 30 days! 

The council advised all 5 of us tenants who were there at the time apply for a Rent Repayment Order to get up to a max of 12 months rent refunded due to the lack of HMO licence. They said as we have signed agreements and can prove we’ve paid rent with bank statements, and our deposits are in the deposit scheme we will win hands down. They’ve made it clear he’s a rogue illegal landlord.",08-01-2021 10:03 AM,£725

We very seriously considered staying for a third year. Three good size bedrooms and one very small one. Living room was very big and kitchen was reasonable. Garden was a nice addition, but was small and didn\'t have any privacy from neighbours. The area is very well connected with good access to shops, the northern line, a big morrisons and sainsburys, camden nightlife, and primrose hill.

Water/heating - There were some very significant boiler issues during the tenancy. It broke several times for extended periods over the winter, and the heating was never really up to scratch, as a result of a centralized boiler for the whole block of houses. The boiler also once leaked through and nearly collapsed the bathroom ceiling. When this was being repaired, the plumber warned us he found asbestos, and the managing agent would never provide us any asbestos safety records when pressed.

Noise/safety - The property is very loud as it is in central camden. People would regularly be playing music and partying outside until the early hours of the morning on weekend nights. Even with these surroundings, the neighbour was militant at making noise complaints if we ever had a party. There was at least one mugging/assault in the park out front during the late night, but the business of the area meant we never felt in danger. 

Managing agents - The principal managing agent (Little Estate Company) was very slow and would always avoid doing things if he could. We learned his colleague was much better, and we would try to speak to this colleague whenever we could. The managing agent was also quite rude once we told him we were moving out, and even got into a shouting match with one of the tenants over the quality of the end of tenancy professional clean.

It doesn\'t look it, as the flat itself looked very nice, but this was the worst property we\'ve ever lived in. What has made our stay there a living hell was the absent landlords and their incompetent property management agency. The landlords live in Australia and every maintenance request took long weeks to answer - and usually with a refusal or a perfunctory response. And we had to work hard for even this poor service, chasing and sending reminders. The management property simply ignore your e-mails. Unless the landlords were obliged to fix the issue by law (and you\'d be surprised how narrow the list is - we\'ve become an experts now), nothing got fixed. We moved into a flea-ridden property (from the previous tenants\' cat) filled with building debris. We spent 5 nights in a hotel and had to force the landlords to eradicate the fleas. The hotel expenses and removal of debris were never reimbursed.  The entrance light took close to 18 weeks to fix, with the tenants having to chase the property management for a response. For 4 months we needed a torch to enter our home. The garden tap, the hob and cooker, the vents, the shutters, the windows (most broken or painted shut) and massive damp - were never fixed. The worst problem was severe damp, with black smelly mould growing in every room of the property - during our entire tenancy (pregnant and then with a newborn baby) this was not fixed at all. Beware - this was not evident in our viewings of the property.  The poor care of the property and the terrible landlords have made our life there very difficult and this is the only reason we have left at the end of the first tenancy period.

Most things needed more than one repair as the entire time the landlord was just looking to do things cheaply. The agents expect a lot of help organising everything and are very rude and we had an almost total lack of quiet enjoyment a lot of the time. When we left there was horrible damp and leaks that had been there months, attempts to fix were useless and required more expensive work the landlord basically didn\'t want to do. The toilets are a nightmare, the plumbing wasn\'t done properly and the loft one blocks and spits up into the sink, the main one is dirty and old and it doesn\'t flush well. I waited 6 days without a main toilet and was ill and confined to that floor a lot of the time, The decking was repaired after 2 years but was rotting at entry and we had to constantly ask them to fix it. Leaks all over the place with stains on 4 different ceilings. This is just a landlord that doesn\'t want to spend any money and gets the cheapest person possible to do minor repairs instead of proper ones. The electrics are terrible, the oven is always turning the whole of downstairs off and then it won\'t go back on. The water pressure has to stay on halfway so you can only ever use one outlet at once. The paintwork is horrible, they\'ve used chalk paint or something that easily comes off and makes the walls dirty quickly. There was a hole in the floor under the carpet in one room and many places that were weak and likely to go too. The landlord asked for a rent increase on the week of lockdown when we had a few months to go and were having to wait for viewings! We are being asked now to pay for the frosted glass sticker the landlord placed on a window because the mould spread into it and created a pink warm mould underneath it that was certainly not safe. Our sinuses are much better after moving.  We would NOT recommend anyone live here because the agents and landlords are not going to look after you, they don\'t care at all and the place needs extensive work done.",04-08-2020 11:01 AM,£2833

I have asked the landlord to reset the timer, as we were not allowed to turn the heating on by ourselves when it was needed, but there was a complete lack of understanding. On the contrary, the landlord started to complain that the bills are too high and stopped answering my messages on any topic.
Also as it was my first time renting in UK I didn\'t know what type of contract to expect so  I\'ve found out  later that the landlord has given me a lodger contract instead of an AST even though he was not living in the house.

Just one, which we had to go and cut for the rest of the tenants and didn\'t refund. Agency and landlady always blaming each other. 

Landlady was horrible. Said she\'d  have the house cleaned before we moved in. It was left in terrible condition. Loads of stuff went wrong. Leaks, ceiling falling down, blocked drains etc. She would take ages to fix them and would just do patch jobs and they would happen again. 

At end of tenancy landlady tried to take our full deposit for made up reasons and we had to chase her through the courts and eventually and rightfully got it back. Have been affected psychologically by this truly terrible experience. Left feeling helpless and angry.

The fridge door wasn\'t mounted properly and was always coming off; we had to re-secure it every 2-3 months.

The address was Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road, London SE23 3HN. The only reason I have put it as the address above is that my address doesn\&#39;t come up on the postcode finder and I was advised to do this and clarify the details. I never dealt at all with Sure2Move - all of my dealings were directly with Landlord. My story of renting from Landlord is as follows. I moved into the Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road on 1st September 2008. While until recently we enjoyed a fairly amicable relationship, Landlord was historically been negligent about attending to structural repairs in the property. For example, within my first few months of moving in, I had occasion to complain Landlord to the council over his inaction in protecting the property against pigeon excrement. On the 26th October 2011 I first let him know about the damp issue. No action was taken on this till 2015; and while the damp in the main room was repaired (due to a faulty pipe on the outside of the property, for which the permission of Lewisham Council was needed), the wall is still exposed and as Lewisham Council pointed out when they came around on 19th February 2016, there were mould spores there. There also is clearly damp along the main alley-facing wall of the flat. In April 2014, renovation works started on Landlords’s son’s flat above. I did give Landlord permission at the time to store building materials in my courtyard, on the understanding that they would be gone by July. In June 2014, I told Landlord that I had witnessed rats in the backyard. It took until November 2014 for some of the rubbish to be cleared; however a good portion still remains in my courtyard to this day – a courtyard that is included in my contract. Between June 2015 – January 2016 I recorded leaving my keys with Landlord&#39;s handyman and so-called property manager  at least 20 times over a combined period of approximately 40 days, so he could repair the damp, clear the backyard, fix an exposed area around the boiler and latterly, arrange for the building to be re-spiked against pigeons (during the renovations some spikes had not been replaced). There are a number of texts between myself and Landlord and myself and Handyman to this end. At the end of October I informed Handyman that I had spoken to someone at Lewisham Council, and I intended involving them if action wasn’t taken. No action was taken, so on December 4th 2015 I informed Landlord that I intended to get the council involved, to which he made it very clear that he was aggrieved. He has alleged since that he arranged for all these jobs to be done from January 6th; however I never received any notice for him to visit the property, or indeed any inkling that this was in hand. I was promised by his handyman  by phone that the back garden would be cleared and the pigeon spiking would be done by January 19th. This didn’t happen, and I was subsequently promised that it would happen by January 26th. This also didn’t happen On February 11th or 12th, I contacted the EHES team at Lewisham council and arrangements were made to come visit the property on the 19th February. On February 17th I let handyman know by phone that the council would be coming, and on February the 18th I left a voicemail asking to be kept informed. Later on the 18th February a Section 21 was in my postbox. I was emailed by landlord on the 19th February to let me know it was there. I did not reply and then was texted by him on the 22nd of February. I phoned him to let him know I needed more time to consider my options, and he seemed fine with me taking a week or so. On the 24th February I emailed him (email already with Lewisham Council). He replied on the 24th February offering a reasonable increase in rent to £750pcm (although a steep increase at 36%, I felt if the issues were dealt with in the flat it would be a price worth paying for the remaining months I intended to stay, due to immigrating in the autumn to Germany). I did not reply to him, but on the 25th February he texted me to tell me he was reconsidering his offer, as he didn’t like the ‘tone’ of my email (which had been seen and approved by Lewisham Council as being reasonable and balanced - their take on it was that he was \&#39;lucky\&#39; that I was giving him such an easy way out of an illegal eviction). Later that day he texted me to say he rescinded his Section 21 but would be happy to rent it out to me at ‘market’ value (in his estimation, £900pcm – which is at least £100 over the market value of similar-sized properties in the area which are at a far higher maintenance level structurally). I emailed him back that day to say I would need professional advice and I would get back to him in a few days. Later that night, at 22.18pm, Landlord sent  me an email with his timeline overview, an assertion that I won’t want to pay £900pcm and telling me he had found a room in a houseshare property for me in the area via Zoopla. At this juncture, I had already decided to re-visit SHIP Housing Options at Lewisham Council upon the advice of one of their call centre operatives, which I did the next day. To say that Landlord is increasingly erratic, harassing and intimidating emails and texts were stressful is to state the obvious. Moreover, his handyman  had a copy of the keys to my flat, which made me increasingly uncomfortable. Lewisham Council really tried to help me by mediating with landlord, but to no avail. They subsequently sent me an email trail in which he basically said he had been giving me a cheaper rent all these because he thought our relationship was \&#39;more\&#39; than landlord and tenant. He alluded to an episode of which I had made the council already aware of, whereby I missed a month\&#39;s rent in 2011 due to financial hardship, and he told me to pay back only half when I had it - which I did. However this does not negate the fact that he was happy to rent out a substandard property for 5 years after, during which time his rubbish from building was stored in my courtyard, and I had to endure almost two years of building works in the property above. During that time my kitchen was flooded twice, and it was only due to a conscientious electrician that the lights in the kitchen were repaired. Recently when a BT operative came to inspect the wiring in the estate agents above which was apparently connected to mine (I had no idea about this in the almost 8 years I lived there) she made it clear that it was a hazard waiting to happen. It is clear that his sole intention is to harass me out of the property, by setting a rent that is a 64% increase on what I had been paying, and with no indication that he intends to do anything about the structural maintenance issues outstanding. It transpired that he may have some involvement in a property development happening close to the flat and that his intention was to use my flat as the site office. I was forced into a position whereby I felt I have no choice (for a number of factors, including my own personal safety) but to vacate the property by the end of April. Lewisham Council kindly stepped in to give him my notice, and it seems no coincidence that on the day they did that, one of his workmen jumped in over my wall \&#39;to retrieve tools\&#39;. I contacted Lewisham Council immediately and said to them if they felt it was appropriate to warn landlord that if he trespassed on my property at any point in time during the rest of my tenure, or harassed me in any way, that I would involve the police. I do not know whether that message was passed on. I left my property under duress and because (as it was explained to me by Lewisham Council) I was scuppered by the lack of regulation of private landlords which might have entailed me having to pay Landlord court costs. While I would have preferred a more amicable end to my time in the place I’ve called home for the last almost 8 years, it became very clear to me now Landlord, despite his protestations to the contrary, has had never any intention of fulfilling his legal obligations as a landlord to maintain the property structurally except when it was absolutely unavoidable (as when my kitchen was flooded a number of times from upstairs). There was been a huge toll on my health, physically and mentally, both in terms of living in a property that is well below market maintenance and also in the energy expended in trying to get landlord to fulfil his obligations as a landlord. Landlord owns a number of properties in the area – some of them in a similar state of disrepair from what I\&#39;ve seen – and in my experience of him as a landlord, he tends to rent out to those who might be considered vulnerable i.e. immigrants, women etc. My intention in writing this on Ask Tenants is so other potential tenants looking to rent in the Forest Hill area can avoid dealing with landlord at all costs. According to Lewisham Council, he is now on their watch list of rogue landlords. I have taken a number of video clips and would be happy to post them if useful.",12-05-2016 08:00 AM,£0

However, the main complaint is with the landlord who was:
1) very slow to respond to any issues, often did so with a bad attitude
2) refused to fix the damaged (potentially dangerous) flooring, which meant we\'d get complaints about noise from downstairs
3) took 6 weeks to replace the broken washing machine (suggesting we pay for the repair, when I\'d only just moved in)
4) refused to pay to fix the loo (which had needed repair before I moved in)
5) kept promising to replace the broken sofas - this never happened
6) put no blinds up in the kitchen
7) wouldn\'t fix the TV connection (therefore we had no TV)
8) shared the dodgy wifi between ours and the flat he owned below, rendering it useless for streaming and unable to work from home
9) had no temperature control, so the place is constantly boiling, even in summer and also means...
10) there\'s a lot of noise from the main road nearby from needing the windows open, which are single glazed anyway.
11) doesn\'t check flatmate references - one flatmate lied about what they did for a job, that they were a smoker and owned a dog which they would hardly ever walk - their replacement accused the other flatmate of being racist and intentionally left used tissues in the shared spaces when Covid happened.
12) did not protect our deposit until we made him, which was then outside the 30 day required period.

This Landlady ignored my concerns. 
Irresponsible. 
Facilities are left below standard for extended periods of time without explanation. 
Impossible to contact. 

There were issues with the electricity in the kitchen early on. This left the other tenants and myself without the ability to boil the kettle or to do a load of washing without tripping the fuze. Obviously this was very inconvenient. While I was living there, at least 4 different \&#34;repair men\&#34; came to fix the problem (Some of them even came without any Tools). This went on for at least 3 months (from 31.12.2015 till 5.4.2016) and the problem was still there when I left. 

The shower pump also had stopped working so the pressure in the shower was depressing. This problem took around 2 months to fix. I would ask for an update on the progress once a week or so - this request usually seemed to be ignored. Her daughter was living in the house too in the upstairs room. She took on the task of spying on myself and the other lodgers, reporting to landlady when we had guests stay overnight which I was only aware of after Landlady decided to with-hold part of my deposit of £50 per week for an extra guest. This amount was never discussed or mentioned previously. I had also had a discussion with her before taking the room about my girlfriend being able to stay occasionally (who was my only guest) as we lived in separate countries. She of course was fine with this arrangement on an \&#34;occasional\&#34; basis but still decided to withhold £85 of my deposit. She also decided to charge me £20 for some damage to the fridge seal. (Which the photos I took on vacating the flat on my last day show no damage). To this day I have not seen a receipt for the repair or evidence of the damage itself, she simply decided to keep my money. 

During my stay there, landlady had gone for a holiday to the Caribbean for several months and she only arrived back to London after I left the property. This was fine but she was impossible to contact 99% of the time. Each time I needed to contact her about something, I would text her and email her and also give her a call (which she very rarely picked up her phone) to make sure she knew I was trying to contact her and to please get back to me. Weeks would go by and nothing so much as a simple txt saying &#34;I&#39;ll get back to you soon&#34; was received. Just complete ignorance. I would send a follow up message, text and call her and leave a voicemail. Again this was ignored time and time again. 

Her daughter was of a similar attitude, as she took responsibility for &#34;Handling&#34; the repairs to the property - when I was unable to get a response from landlady, I sent her a txt asking for a simple update about the repairs so that I can know that something is actually being done about it. (My messages were always courteous and professional). She replied to my txt soon after: &#34;contact your landlord, im not your landlord&#34;. It was clear from then that she was not interested in being at all helpful. My main issue with this property and landlord is not that repairs weren&#39;t attended to in a timely manner or even that landlady took my deposit. Landlady and her daughter were just plain ignorant. Landlady clearly had no interest in managing the property, it has become apparent that she just wanted to take as much money as possible from her lodgers while putting in the least amount of effort. After landlady sent me an email advising that she was withholding some of my deposit, I sent her a professionally drafted email requesting a receipt for the repair and to discuss the amounts she had decided to withhold. This email was also ignored and I have not received any reply in weeks. 

Don&#39;t move in here and avoid this property all together. Good luck finding a nice place, there are good spots and good landlords out there, I just know it! :)",29-06-2016 04:27 PM,£0

The bathrooms and kitchens are fairly new and modern. However, there are mould issues. One of the bedrooms has mould all around the skirting and in the wardrobe. As a result, personal possessions are completely destroyed by mould. The landlord painted everything in anti-mould paint but the mould still came back. The bedroom really smells of damp so I think it\'s an issue within the building. There is also mould in the bathroom and actual mushrooms grew through the grout! The handyman believed there was a leak in the upstairs flat which caused all of this (as you could often hear water running down the internal wall) but he never investigated it.

The flooring is quite poor and coming up in places. The kitchen has been designed very badly and has very little space to store anything.

It\'s a shame because it could be a nice flat but the upkeep is really neglected and mould issues are not taken seriously.

Some of the neighbours smoke a lot of weed constantly and the smell can come into the flat too which is frustrating.

There is a bus stop right outside which can be very loud. This also leads to lots of rubbish accumulating around the front of the property/front door step. Even though the landlord owns the whole block, as far I\'m aware he doesn\'t organise for this to be cleaned and individual tenants have to clean it.

The landlord is not good. I raised the issues of mould multiple times and his only solution was to paint over everything in anti-mould paint rather than address the root cause.

When the handyman visited he said he thought there may be a leak upstairs which caused the mould, as you could hear water running down the wall. He kept saying he would investigate this but never did.

When I left, I asked the landlord for compensation as so many of my possessions had been ruined by mould. He essentially said the mould was my fault for not airing the room properly so he would not be compensating me. The issue is that the room has been fitted with vents on the outside walls and the wardrobe doors which suggests to me that this has always been an issue, otherwise they would not have been installed. My flatmate also informed me that the previous tenant had issues with mould too. The room was as well ventilated as it could be given that it was a ground floor, front-facing room on a busy road in London, so the windows couldn\'t be constantly open for safety reasons - I\'m not too sure what the landlord expects tenants to do. I also had the extractor fan on for hours after I had a shower, but the handyman told the landlord that he visited the property and I didn\'t have it on. It seemed to me that they were all working together to cover up the mould issue because they couldn\'t be bothered to find the cause.

Communication is also incredibly poor. We communicated with the landlord via his secretary who was unhelpful. She doesn\'t reply to emails unless you send multiple follow up emails and call her.

We would often communicate directly with the handymen when we needed something fixed, due to the secretary not replying. They couldn\'t commit to which days they would visit, often 3 days later than initially agreed and acted with no urgency when we had serious issues.

When you leave the property, the landlord doesn\'t pay you back the deposit directly and you have to wait for the new tenant to pay you. They don\'t ask the new tenant to pay you as soon as possible so you can be left waiting for ages after you\'ve moved out for them to pay you. This could be resolved by the landlord managing the deposit better.",23-09-2022 11:26 AM,£1570

He was also very aggressive on several occasions when we have had disagreements, especially with my flatmate.
Another serious issue we have had was that the flat was very cold throughout the whole winter, we complained many times, but nothing was done. The bills were included in our rent and we offered to pay more if he were to raise the heat, but he did not.
There was a leak in my room as I was away, it stained the walls, my bedsheets, etc,... and nothing was done. He even reproached me for the stain on the wall when I handed in the keys.
We live in the basement of the house, and there are people living upstairs. Their kitchen was above my room and the noise was a nuisance all year around, there is no insulation whatsoever. The worst was the washing machine that was often on late at night.
There are a lot of spiders around the house, and from the scratching noises we hear at night, we believe that it is likely that there are rats upstairs.
When we handed in the keys, he threatened us with taking part of our deposit back fr things that were already damaged when we first entered the flat.
There is also a huge problem with waste management in the neighborhood. There is litter on the floor constantly.
Other than that, the area is close to the university (30 minutes walking), Asda, the curry mile. The bathroom has been refurbished recently.",30-06-2016 01:00 PM,£822

-You are living above a function room (club for rent) which is used most Fridays and Saturdays and will be open and noisy until 3/4am on these days

The landlord chose not to renew my contract, and she had told the property manager that this was because I had told her I wanted to move out - this never happened, she never even consulted me. Months later and surprise surprise, her daughter is moving into my old room. If you wanted to make room for your daughter in the flat then you should just be honest about it, rather than fabricating a conversation (to save face I suppose?).

My other issue is with charges from my deposit. I was charged hundreds of pounds from my deposit for a new kitchen worktop, even though the worktop was already damaged when I moved in. The landlord actually assured me, to my face, that I would not be charged for this. Apparently honesty means nothing?
The other charge that is absurd is that the door handle was broken the entire time I lived there, and after reporting it multiple times, was never fixed. The landlord came to fix it once, but basically she put it back on, without fixing the problem. So it slid off again immediately. I reported this again and nothing was done about it. I had to live without a door handle for an entire year, keeping a sock in the door to keep it from shutting so I wouldn\'t get stuck inside. And I got charged for it. It\'s a joke. The people living in the flat are amazing people, good friends of mine. The management is shocking. Please find somewhere else to live for your own sake.",09-04-2023 04:31 PM,£850

On viewing the property, all seemed tidy and he seemed pretty decent. 

On moving in, I discovered that the boiler / heating system was faulty - ie there is no hot water on unless the heating is on full blast - the wheezy water tank is in my room. Landlord is aware of this and refuses to fix the issue.

He also claims he has the boiler serviced and annual safety inspections done - but is unable to provide evidence.

There is also regular leaking of water from the bathroom into the electrics into the ceiling below - again, the landlord refuses to fix this and claims this is NOT a safety issue as it doesnt leak all the time and that their is no risk of an electrical fire if water gets into the wiring as it will self-regulate.
Further, the landlord lives like a pig in a sty - his washing, dishes, DIY goods, childs toys, empty bottles, beer cans and other clutter litter the house everywhere - there is NO access to the communal areas ie dining table and lounge as these are filled with his junk. 

Issues have also included the kitchen tap breaking - as he was going away, he refused to fix it and for a week there was no running water in the kitchen - even for a few days after he was back - he would go to the garden and get water out the hose tap to fill the kettle!

When he has massive binge drinking sessions, he and his friends are out in the garden all night - weeing all over the paving, being sick in the kitchen sink - this too is not cleaned for days.

Other pleasant habits of his include having loud sex with his girlfiend with his door wide open, enjoying \""himself\"" - again with the door wide open to his room - its cringeworthy!

He has also had endless issues with the poor old lady next door - they share a chimney breast which was on the verge of collape. The poor old lady was so worried however my landlord REFUSED to pay his share of the costs and REFUSED to admit it needed to be replaced and had this poor lady stressing for months until he finally agreed to pay the costs he is obliged to.

The garden is a hazardous construction site - wood and nails and rubble debris everywhere.
I have tried raising the issue with him, and said that I am paying rent for a property and it needs to be clean and that he has basic legal responsibilities - he has said he does not, and that I rent a room and that its HIS HOUSE and he will do what he wants.

I am a female - he also regularly wanders around the house in his underwear or no clothes at all.

As for his bathroom habits - he leaves his shavings everywhere, has no idea how to clean mould off the walls, leaves globs of toothepaste spit in the sink, wees all over the floor when he is drunk, leaves his marks down the loo bowl - I have to spray with bleach and disinfect after he showers - its FILTHY!

A bonus point - despite the dangerous boiler and electrics - there are no working smoke alarms or carbon monoxide testers in the house. Landlord deems these unnecessary too. 

I honestly dont know of any living or dead creature that would or should live here.

Worst bit is he has a 6 year old daughter who visits and creates more mess - and who at the age of  is still sleeping in bed with dad. He is often very drunk or hungover and sleeps away on the sofa while she is left to her own devices - eventually the poor kid climbs on him and I find them there on the sofa the next day.

The flat itself is nice, bright, looking smart living room/kitchen. I had leaks issues (which happens).
The big problem I had was the bathroom ceiling collapsed following a leak.
The landlord reaction was dreadful. First I didn\'t know if it would collapse even more so asked for temporary rehousing in an hotel which the landlord refused leaving me in an USAFE property. Only 5 days later a builder inspected the damages saying it was not going to collapsed any further.
It took a month to have the ceiling repaired by the insurance and the landlord refused to give me a discount for the inconvenience to have a broken ceiling.
The deposit : the landlord refuses to refund me £375 of my deposits saying it isn\'t clean enough (I spent an afternoon with a friend cleaning the whole flat) and he isn\'t providing any bills to justify these costs. I am about to start a dispute process obviously.

1. Our landlord said our electricity bill will be near nothing due to the fact that there are solar panels. However, once we moved in, we then found out that none if the power the solar panels generate goes into our electricity bills, instead they go into our landlords’ bank accounts, and of course we don’t get any discounts on our electricity bills.

2. Before moving in, our landlords said they wanted to save having to get rid of some old furniture (sofa, chairs, beds, chests of drawers), so asked if we would use them, if so they can leave them here. But if we ever want to get rid of them and get our own furniture because they were quite old, then we can do so. So we agreed because it saved them having to spend money and effort, and we didn’t mind having them in our home temporarily. However, they now said that they want everything they left behind to be here in perfect conditions. 

During Covid, when most landlords have given help to tenants, reducing rent, delaying rent or even canceling rent, we did not receive any help, nor did we even asked for it. And when it comes to us asking if we can have a 5-month contract or a rolling contract for 5 months after being here for two years and not missing one rent, they refused to do so and chose to kick us out early. We asked to have a 5-month contract rather than 6-month contract because we are moving to another country, and now we are left in a very difficult situation because we don’t know where we can go after the date they wanted us out and before we move. We even asked if we can just leave two weeks after the date and they still refused to.

The Good - The viewing process was easy and uncomplicated with the agent being able to answer any questions we had. Similarly in terms of signing the documents and providing proof of ID this again was quite seamless. Phone calls from your end were prompt and informed. We appreciated this. Terry’s work putting up pictures / hooks etc was also well received. 
Areas where we felt let down – The Referencing agent you chose, KeySafe Ltd. KeySafe provide no tenant contact details, charge large fees and, in our experience did little to help tenants move through the referencing process. We provided details of referees to KeySafe who told us no-one answered when they emailed, this despite my being in the office of my previous letting agent when KeySafe stated they had sent the email. We faced long waits for this process, and in all honesty felt like we paid several hundred pounds to do our own referencing.  Note KeySafe did not reply to my repeated attempts to discuss this with them, and the Financial Ombudsman lodged it as a cause for concern. I don’t know if you’re still using them, but if you are, I would recommend you consider whether they are providing just a service for yourselves to the detriment of tenant experience. 
Living in the Cargo
The Good – Quiet, warm and well insulated with nice fittings and always clean in communal areas. The Gym is a nice facility, and the lounge looks inviting if a little quiet. The courtyard is well kept.
Areas for development – The lift in building 2 on the left was broken for a significant period of time, often with little apparent haste to get it repaired. Once it was working, it then broke again shortly after. Recent times have been better, but I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say 6 weeks of no lift was a little more than inconvenient. 
A little niggle, but one none-the-less, the post-boxes are in the wrong entrance i.e. ours was in the right-hand side set, when we live in the left hand set. Such a simple thing to rectify and would make a difference to lots of tenants. 
The smell on level -1 in the left lift in building 2. Despite this being reported multiple times, a strong smell still lingers there, more so than in other areas. Clearly a bin accident has occurred, but it hasn’t felt like a priority to fix it.
Cargo Staff and Reception
The Good – All the reception and concierge team are friendly, polite and professional and have a good relationship with residents. Parcels are taken and noted down which is really helpful and they always offer to pass on messages promptly. 
The Not so good – I wrote to you regarding the issues with meter reads, and you were appropriate in responding to those issues with a reasonable plan for this. Unfortunately, of the following 4 times I have asked for meter reads, only 2 have arrived within the agreed time frame, once it was forgotten, and once I had to chase it via the management. Perhaps an alternative solution might a resident’s online portal where you can Ask for Meter Reads with a log of the time of the request and the time it was provided, Get notified when a Parcel Arrives, and Submit Questions to the concierge team? It wouldn’t be technically difficult but would provide a useful means of corresponding
The Renewal Process
The renewal process, as you are a commercial organisation, I was suppose always going to lead to an increase in rent, however I remain of the opinion that residents have not really had any quantifiable increase in value since the increase. The adaptations to the gym offers a reasonable added space, however at the cost cumulatively to the building’s residents I’m not sure it justifies the £1.92/resident/week increase. Nevertheless, one has to put a price on convenience of staying, and once the niggles of the previous 12 months were ironed out, the process moved on.
I would note once again the signing of documents, adjusted rent calculations and general speed of this process was not overly-impressive, requiring me to proactively chase the team to ask where things were up to, carrying on living in the apartment without a new contract for a significant time period, which puts both your organisation and ourselves in difficult legal situation. However, once the time came, and after my writing to you about the meter reads, a calculation of rent was provided promptly.
The Tone of Communications
The Good - The Cargo offers many communications to residents over the year, from seasonal events like the Pumpkin carving, to updates about parcels now and then. Generally the emails and tone from the Reception guys is friendly and amicable. These events and activities are nice opportunities for residents to get to know each other and I’ve met a number of residents through these. The reception team are always friendly and helpful when you need them. Again, we appreciated this. 
Areas of development – I am again remembering that you are, inevitably, a commercial organisation first, and resident support team second, who need to ensure that rents are paid, income is maintained and revenue maximised. Recently, I feel that there’s been a slight culture change in the tone of your emails:
-	Anyone not holding a valid car parking permit will have access restricted
-	Will be asked to pay retrospective charges
-	Any residents leaving trays in the corridor will be charged
I also walked past a car with a note on the windscreen highlighting “illegal parking” parked on the front courtyard. I appreciate this must be an issue for you since the barriers have to be down now, however I would be careful about using the term “illegal parking” as, if anything, it would be a civil offence, and even then, until you acquire either both a BPA and IPC license, you would not be in a position to enforce this.
I appreciate your requests in all these area stem from genuine issues, be it car parking issues, Tesco trolleys in the corridor, or rubbish in the lifts, however the tone, as a resident, is that of “do as we say or you will be financially penalised”. We all know that re-enforcement does not work nearly as well positive. Furthermore, in any well-functioning organisation, issues like this are seen as opportunities to learn, so for example one might just fine a motorist, or they might ask why is that person parking there, is it because they can’t get access to the car park, are they a visitor who you have clarified are not allowed to park, or is there another reason. Rather than resorting to charging your residents, perhaps try and think more about why these issues occur, and try to mitigate these reasons.
Moving Out
Again, you are a commercial organisation, and your interests, at the end of the day, are to protect the Landlord’s investment. To that end, it came as no surprise that you levied inappropriate charge. At the commencement of our tenancy, you advised that if we used Terry to put up decorations, that this would not involve a charge, however, predictably you reneged on this at the end of the tenancy, and charged a “nominal” amount for this. As promised, this will be communicated on public platforms for other tenants to see. 
Final Comments
Living in a new flat, with a great view and location has been amazing, and for city centre living, the Cargo genuinely offers a premium option. Day to day cargo residence is convenient and pain-free, with most issues quickly resolved by friendly and approachable staff. I would recommend living here to anyone. 
I would implore all those who take out tenancies to take lots of photos when they move in, get any verbal commitments agreed in writing and ensure that concerns are escalated early. 
Thank you for an enjoyable tenancy, and I wish you all the best for the future.",18-04-2020 09:44 AM,£1325

I noticed it during my first night there and emailed the agency straight away. Unfortunately, I paid 6 months in advance (as I am self-employed and it seemed easier that way.. I guess, lessons learned). 

The agency and the landlord were very uncompromising. I was surprised at how little sympathy I had from them. I have emailed them asking to release me from the contract or to call an engineer to look for a solution, but had very little help. My GP sent them a letter saying that the vibrations were causing my headaches, but still no response. I installed the app that was measuring the vibrations and sent the results to the agency, but unfortunately, they ignored it. The engineer\'s fee was over a thousand pounds which I was happy to pay but they needed to lift the carpets and the agency/landlord didn\'t allow it.  

They arranged a few viewings (after 4 months of weekly correspondence with them) and kept saying that they are being very generous to me. However, nothing ever came out of those viewings. Only after 6 months when I left, they waited for a month (so that they could use my deposit) and then found new tenants. 

The agency is called - Mountgrange heritage Kensington branch. 

The neighborhood is nice and the bedroom is facing private gardens. Unfortunately, the flat needs work to address this issue. I hope this review saves someone from the situation I was in with this flat.

Initially the landlord and the agents at CKD were very enthusiastic, showing us the property, showing us the heating system and how the landlord had designed the whole house himself. 

We snapped up the property as its beautiful. Once we moved in we realised things were not going to be very good for us. For starters, the heating system in the property is not adiquate for the size of the property so unless we used convector heaters the house never got higher than 18 Degrees. Then our dishwasher broke. Rather than having an expert come and fit it the landlord Peter Shepheard asked if I would help him fit it so that he could save costs. We spent nearly an entire day trying to fit a dishwasher. We eventually did it with a dodgy fitted door. But anyway - it worked so yay!

The landlord would pop round the property a few times a week without notice to inspect the garden, he beloved apple tree hes growing (which we were told not to touch  as he would deal with it - in our home!). On multiple occassions he let himself into the property while my partner was home with our children. Totally unacceptable behaviour.

The garage door was poorly fitted on build and we noticed it was getting to a point it may fall from the garage roof. As I was parking my new Mercedes in the garage I was very concerned about this so asked the landlord to have it fixed. Guess what? Thats right - no professional, just Peter, A Drill and some screws. The results were loads of screws drilled into the garage roof to support the door. A very untidy and unprofessional job and I was not happy parking my car in the garage any longer.

We gave our notice to the property sighting issues with broadband (yes its terrible) and the landlord tried his very best to make us stay - even by withholding a reference for 2 weeks!. As soon as we did take on a new property Peter\'s attitude changed. He became very needy by email - writing to me sometimes 5 times per day demanding access to the property. He also emailed us multiple times a day demanding we surrender the lease early as he has a new renter lined up. 

In the end I had to issue him with a demand to stop contacting me or face Criminal Harassment charges. He backed off and never spoke to us again.

My advice? Stay well away from this property unless your happy with a meddling old man popping round to make sure your looking after his show home. There are nicer and more efficient properties available for that sort of money.",21-03-2017 12:17 PM,£1150

Any concern was never properly dealt with, and at times, was laughed away. We wanted a lock fitted to the front door to enable us to get insurance, however, the agency laughed at us telling us a lock is not needed in London!!! Needless to say the lock was never installed and we were constantly told \""we will ask the landlord\"".

I was never inducted into the property and things were not explained properly. I was only told by my housemate that we couldn\'t use the dishwasher (as I was never told) and then I was only told about hidden storage options 3 weeks before moving out (after 8/9 months in the property). This came after numerous disputes regarding storage. 

It took 6/7 months to finally get a key for the front door. For those months we had to go in through the back door by the communal bins.

Even though a weekly cleaner was included in the rental cost, we saw no evidence of a cleaner doing any sort of cleaning job. When we mentioned this to them, they would always say \""its a courtesy\"". Therefore, the communal areas would get dirtier and then we would be told to keep the place clean

Finally, on many, many occasions, we would return home from work and find that the agency had been in the flat and moved everything round in the kitchen. When we asked why, they would only say \""its a communal area, you sign for the room\"". However, as it is communal, we had all been okay with how the kitchen had looked.

I would severely recommend not signing with this agency. For the whole tenancy, we were lied to and had false promises made constantly.",12-07-2016 09:29 AM,£800

But BE AWARE the property has condensation in its severest form, the built in wardrobe is along the external wall and in winter the water makes it way through, leaving all clothes wet. Thick black mould forms everywhere, particularly severe in small bedroom. When i was checking out i moved my daughters bed to realise that my daughter was sleeping in the company of thick black mould for months and we did not know as it was hidden by the bed. 

In summer carpet moths will make an entry there were hundreds of them and in the night they fly - you find them even on your bed.

Landlady does not want to spend any money. She only has a half handyman who tries to fix things temporarily. Kenwood guys proposed her a permanent solution for condensation but she did not want to spend the money - it costed about £2k.

So if you can manage to live in a property with mould and moths - i.e. use bleach and clean mould every day, use dehumidifiers (2-3 of them, one provided by landlady), use moth sprays and moth remedies, go for this flat.

They end contract before official end date to get new tenants at higher price every year so its not a stable home environment for any family wanting to rent this property as the long term contract is never fulfilled however I was there for over a year but given section 21 and told it was sold but now seen it’s on rent again after moving out for more than double the rent I paid. Most importantly the property was left in better condition than when moving in and maintained well and the checking out reports from estate agents provided this information but the landlords delay and demand damages even when advised not to by the agents making a fuss for things the agent says is unreasonable so I have to claim from TDS . Landlord thinks they can make extra money from tenants deposits and increase rent exceptionally high by moving tenants every year when there was a 3 year contract.  I am not the first to experience this when I did my research on this property. If you are a family wanting security then there is a game played by landlords not considering the tenants at all especially wanting deposit monies when deemed unreasonable even by Chancellors the estate agents who try to sell or rent consistently for years now.  Just be aware if you want honesty and landlords with integrity then you will not find that with this property and I don’t want another family to go through what I did.  The neighbours either side of the house are nice but the street has a few incidents of antisocial behaviour to the point that police have turned up opposite the house on many occasions.,05-11-2023 04:15 AM,

Some positives, but more negatives unfortunately

Positives:
- big gardens
- big kitchen
- big living/dining area

Negatives:
- all windows are loose in the reveals, resulting in banging and draughts constantly. Also, not all keys provided for windows, so can\'t open them all.
- generally poor standard - \'newly fitted\' carpets are all loose and badly fitted. They pull out from the thresholds when you push the hoover over them.
- side door is unusable, due to the terrible attempt at brickwork that should be toothed into the house. Will fall down at some point.
- Cavities exposed where pipework has been run out, no attempts made to fill around pipes.
- external doors very poorly fitting.
- third bedroom won\'t fit a full size single bed in it, so certainly not a 3 bed house.
- Landlord has no interest in fixing issues - reported leaks and maintenance tickets were cancelled. Radiator still leaking when we left. Reported poorly fitting door/lock, were told it\'s just the weather. Except we couldn\'t get out of the property, as the lock was jammed shut. After a lot of trying, the handle pulled off the door and we had to fix this ourselves. The cheek to then be told after leaving that the back door lock is sticking and doesn\'t lock - we\'ve mentioned this numerous times on inspections and nothing was done. The same goes with the cistern in the bathroom. It came away from the wall within a week of being in the property. Due to poor fitment, it had been pushed back and secured to the wall with grab adhesive, which then pulled the plaster off. We fixed this ourselves too. The shower over the bath stopped working after someone \'fixed\' the hot tap that fell off. Never rectified. 
- none of the kitchen lower unit doors close properly, without physically pushing them all the way home.

It\'s a real shame, because the property could be so much better, and would make a fantastic home with some investment from the landlord. Unfortunately, despite being clear of most COVID rules, we were unable to physically view the property prior to moving in, rather, were sent a video walkround.

No corridors. All rooms with lots of light. Kitchen and living room are merged and provide a wonderful social space. Since the property is somewhat more elevated than the surrounding buildings, the kitchen and the main bedroom have a very pleasant view over the gardens of neighbouring houses.
The landlady is extremely friendly and accommodating. We have had some minor issues with leaks from the apartment above, and with the boiler, but they were settled immediately.
The only nuisance is the garbage area at the back of the house, which most often is a big mess (the house is divides in 6 apartments). 
The area is very family friendly. Several good schools in walking distance. Our son attended Ashmount primary school and Highgate Wood secondary school.
The nearby Parkland walk is extremely convenient for running, strolling, or walking the dog.
Also nearby shops, nice restaurants and pubs, Elthorne Park (with great football pitch), and a GP.
15 min walk (or 5 min bus ride) to Finsbury Park (Victoria and Picadilly lines) and to Archway (Northern line).",06-07-2016 05:19 PM,£0

At the time I moved out it didn\'t look like it was going to be fixed and it had been the case for more than 5 years. There are several boilers in the common areas of the building that are supposed to supply all the flats with heating and hot water, and all of the boilers are past serviceable life. 
I lived in the flat from September 2017 till April 2018. In the first four months (September-December 2017) I didn\'t have hot water for approximately one week out of every month, and no heating at all for most of that period because of the problems with boilers. This included the Christmas holiday. On 13 January heating was completely switched off in all the flats to prioritise hot water, and had not been restored by the time I moved out in April. Windows in the building are single-glazed, so it was freezing cold. Problems with hot water persisted. The building management sent a letter saying they would present a plan on how to raise funds to fix the boilers by the end of Q1 2018 which wasn\'t done at the time I moved out (end of April 2018).
On top of constant boiler issues my flat was also broken into despite this being a portered block with CCTV. A known criminal (based on CCTV footage) broke the entire lock mechanism off of the door while I was at work (see photos below). 
I contacted my landlord and Westminster Council regarding the boiler issues, but I was told nothing could be done to fix this situation as Arthur Court is a freehold agreement, and some of the owners didn\'t want to pay for boiler replacement.

The building is made of wood and the noise of the car they constantly put in, take out to clean is excruciating. The garage is constantly being opened. The noise of the garage door seems like a chain from the Tower of London. Listen to that several times in the day, specially now, working from home, and you will soon become insane. 

Another thing they failed to mention was that the landlord would be working full-time under the place where you live. He does a lot of wood work and fixing so you can hear wood being cut very, very loudly. He will deny it despite, you have seen him by going outside.

Since he can be under your floor from 7:30 to 22:30 to 23:00 in the night, including weekends, forget about privacy and quiet enjoyment of your home. 

You also don’t have any recycling bins. You are supposed to use their recycling bins which... are always full. One day after I approached the landlord to get a place to put my kitchen waste he got me a composter. That was really nice but when I returned from a day out he took the composter out without consulting me and, then in a very casual way, told me to clean the massive pile of rotten food that was inside the compost bin. I had to ask for a shovel so I didn\'t have to buy one. The reason? He said he had an infection of rats which is fair enough but, he was the one who put the bin next to my house when, he has a massive land in the back where the bin could have been allocated. And I had to clean that too.

The landlord manages your Mail. So expect your letters to be opened once and awhile, by mistake or not, I am not sure.

My wife and I have just bought our first new build property, but we had a very good time living in Flat 6. Reasons it is so good include:

1. Location is absolutely amazing, close to the Chelsea Road shops, on the main route for the X39, A4 bus, close to Bristol-Bath bike path and Two Tunnels route; Lidl, M&S, Argos, etc; 20 minute walk to the city centre of Bath. Newbridge area is lovely; I already miss it.

2. Really nicely done out flat; the kitchen is incredible; bathrooms are really well fitted too, modern and in excellent condition.

3. Long nature of the Flat, mostly South facing, means you get the sun shining in through various windows and the flat stays warm and has just a really nice positive feeling to it. We hardly paid anything for bills (about £300 refund from Octopus energy) - you don\'t even need to turn the heating on in winter if the sun is shining. Really well insulated.

4. Two decent sized bedrooms and two bathrooms, including one with a bath which is just amazing. Ashley did a really good job of fitting these.

5. Nice entry way and nicely done out garden space and shedding at the back (bike store).

6. Your own parking space included, right outside the house, without any stressful parallel parks, just no price to put on that.

7. Ashley is an exceptional landlord, a very nice person and always there to answer questions and sort out snags (although honestly there weren\'t very many snags).

Some relatively minor drawbacks:

1. The flat is so well insulated that it does not cool down very much in summer. You will need to invest in a water cooler/ portable air conditioning to be able to sleep.

2. The main road is very noisy if you open the windows (which had to happen in summer months). With the windows closed you can still hear the road, but you get used to it very quickly (and some people like the \""buzz\"" / energy of that). When I was working at home in summer I had to close the windows to hear my videocalls, which made it very hot.

3. Fridge and freezer are relatively small for a 2 bed flat; it\'s the only thing that\'s missing in the kitchen. All the other storage spaces are more than enough; arguably better than our new build kitchen.

Despite the last three minor issues I would give this a 10/10 and would definitely like to still live in the flat if we weren\'t trying to get on the property ladder. You won\'t find a better place like this in Bath in my opinion (and I\'ve looked to comparable places/prices - they are a joke). You won\'t regret choosing here, and personally, I\'d much prefer to pay a private landlord than line the pockets of the letting agents.",30-11-2020 06:31 AM,£1000

There was a range of other slightly less serious issues. 

After constant pressure from me to sort out the most serious issue (gas safety), they sent two different gas engineers. Both concluded that various gas appliances were unsafe. As this and other issues were not resolved promptly, I had to involve the Council. As soon as the landlord knew about the Council\'s involvement, he served a Section 21 notice, making use of the 6-month break clause. I asked for a couple of months so my daughter could finish her school year but the landlord was adamant and even took me to court as retaliation. He intended to keep a substantial percentage of my deposit - we even had to go to arbitration. I finally got my full deposit back but the process was draining and time-consuming.

The plug in the kitchen sink was blocked and smelled disgusting, and the washing machine left clothes steaming for hours afterwards and so hot to the touch that it was worrying.

It is call Flat 2. The main issue is that it is 15 sq. m. including the shower room. (Approximately 150 sq. f.) So it is quite expensive if you look at the price for the area you get. Now I\'ll try to describe it by zones in different paragraphs after talking about admin matters.

You will probably have to rent it paying an state agent but later it is the Landlord who deal with the fixing. At least it was like this when we where there. He didn\'t turn up to sign the contract and a lady from the state agent did it. Later we could find our that the contract wasn\'t that relevant apparently. The deposit was property protected and it took us around 3 weeks to get it after chasing the landlord. Electricity and waters bills are included in the rent. You will have to pay the council tax that it was nearly £1,000 a year.

Out site the building looks and was just a house. Each room has been transformed into an studio so at some point, including the people renting the garden flat, there where around 15 souls living in this place. Whole families are living in these very small studios. Nearly no one recycle property so bins are usually a mess at the front of the house. There is no proper box mail for each flat so letters just arrive for all tenants mixed through the door. There is no proper ring-bells for each flat either. In the entrance you can find an unventilated hall where the boiler tint the walls in black dust. The shared washing machine is also there and it can take up 3 weeks to get fixed (the new one was performing some better though) Generally speaking the shared areas are in bad conditions and this was aggravated by a 2 calendar year construction site next door that was still going on the day we left. Builders were allow to use our shared outside area. This made things really unpleasant. 

Inside, the studio is small. It is basic and quite functional too. The sink does a lot of noise every time the persons upstairs open their tap. And eventually also get blocked and then the landlord send somebody to unblock it. The noise problems don\'t go. We manage to make it OK by using the plug and putting a weight on it. Heating performs nicely. The shower tray is 70 by 70 cm. 

We quite enjoyed the garden by having a shed, having our bikes there and planting strawberries and chives.",24-10-2017 02:03 PM,£0

The high street serves over 10 major bus routes and at least 2 that run 24 hours a day, sleep is at a premium if you live here. The adjoining property is also owned by the same landlord and consists of the same poor standards, in this instance the landlord is taking advantage of the tenants also, knowing that they have nowhere else to go. We made is as best a family home as we could for the 3 years but as soon as we could, we moved. On one occasion I answered the door at 10pm to a man standing with a knife in my face, it was one of the men living in the house next door. Another incident was when the shop below decided to turn the water supply off overnight. When I confronted him, he denied all knowledge, as I went back up to the property, as if magic, the supply was on again! The landlord was called over this, and visited straight away but could not see a problem. Thames Water were also useless as the supply comes through the shop. To summarise, I would avoid this property and landlord like the plague. Whilst the landlord is friendly to speak to, his interest is to trap a tenant in the property, knowing full well that they cannot afford to leave, and not spend a penny of investment or maintenance on the property. You would be better off sleeping in the car park across the road, which by the way, is the only parking space for miles, at £1,200 per year for a parking space. AVOID.",23-08-2016 03:43 PM,£843

The poor communication and unwillingness to fix issues of the landlord though makes it impossible. 
Paulette Lemonius likes to ignore problems, palms off fixing requests and when eventually gets someone in to do work they are handy men without the ability to get the job done well or quickly. Examples: The top apartment’s toilet leaked over our bathroom causing the roof to eventually rot away and fall on our heads while showering. It was over 6 months before anything was done when this issue was first raised and even then it took a number of very long appointments and three different handymen to sort it out. Dry rot has existed in our lounge room for over one year and despite frequent requests it was only dealt with three months ago and has since come back causing paint to bubble and discolor again. No handy man is yet to assist despite many requests with sorting it once and for all. Our most recent saga is that our front door lock has broken and while anyone else would get in a locksmith to sort it quickly her partner tried for 8 hours to sort it and left without the security lock functioning - it doesn’t snob security into the wall. 
A report was provided to the landlord over a year ago recommending the boiler be replaced which hasn’t happened, and the down lights which were fitted years ago by an unqualified electrician not to code and have caused charring on structural beams. Ms Lemonius was issued a notice requiring them to be changed and only 6 of the 24, or 2 rooms, are yet to be done so we’re potentially living in a fire hazard. Our bin is also broken with a missing lid but she won’t pay the £50 to replace it so foxes frequent our patio and make a mess. 
Our neighbours had some similar issues with the responsiveness of the landlord and quality of the flat and left not long ago. 
Street parking is relatively easy and aside from Saturday nights the area is relatively quiet - unless you’re a light sleeper. The planes going overhead at all hours can be a little much. 
People don’t respect traffic signs and speed up and down the street...that coupled with the group of 20 young men who regularly hang at the top of the street smoking weed and doing drug deals, this probably isn’t the place for children. 
Traffic is always congested at Brixton and Clapham North junctions but the flat is close to both the Northern and Victoria tube lines as well as Clapham High St overground. 
Police have notified us of breakins in the street twice in the last year but we’ve never felt unsafe walking around outside.",17-03-2018 04:09 PM,£1550

Any time something broke, the Landlord was always understanding and he tried to fix everything manually himself and i consider him one of the great landlords i have come to know, BUT the agency drives him and the price house as much as possible, asking (sneakily) for rent increases at every possible occasion.

We moved out mainly because they tried to raise the rent by £170 per month (from £1480 to £1650) in a time (last year) when the market was a buyer\'s market. When people from Europe is running back to their countries, leaving many flats empty and prices dropping.

Obviously, they could not manage to get their asking price, so it was rented at £1600 instead and the only way they managed that is by squeezing a 3rd person (in a 2 bedroom house..., probably living in the living room) in, so it looks like a good deal...

In short, old and bad quality furniture, some carpeting was torn and never fixed, we had bed bugs every now and then that we did not introduce (Was there from the beginning) and the lack of trust towards the future on pricing, as well as the attitude towards getting more money out of it from the agents who have never visited the flat (how ironic - pricing something without looking at it) would make me say AVOID.

The entrance is through the back, as the house is on the high street, meaning there is a security door and a loooong corridor before you reach the entrance, meaning that when you are moving in or out or coming in or out from shopping you have a lot of walk and stairs before you are in. Even worse, the corridor to the entrance is always full of long left rotting garbage, flies, fast food left overs, beer bottles and cans and all that because the shops in the front of the house have the code, which they then distribute to their staff to lock their bikes etc.

The security door in question was broken and the landlord did not care to fix it or talk to the other people sharing it to fix it, it was only down to the kindness of one of the businesses to fix it.",25-01-2019 04:44 AM,£1480

I made the place home with my furnitures and belongings, however I would not recommend the place for all the following reasons: 
- Very noisy flat next to the north circular (days, nights, weekends).
- Badly insulated under the roof (I had to vacate the flat on hot days and in winter the flat is constantly cold and my electricity bills between the months of December and March were around £200 a month). 
- The electricity is a top up system so you constantly need to check and run to the convenient store to top up.
- The landlord increased my rent after 2 years, asking me an additional £120 pounds just because he could, leaving me no other option.
- The flat doesn\'t have a dishwasher and although I am only 1.65 cm I had to bend to access the sink area in the kitchen. 
- I had an issue with the main heater in the living room and although I chased the landlord several times in the space of 4 months, it still hasn\'t been fixed. I had to buy an oil heater to keep myself warm this winter. 
- Lack of privacy as the flat share 2 walls with widows with the landlord home. 
- Lack of flexibility from the landlord who has never once been accommodating in 4 years, despite myself being a clean, quiet tenant who pays on time. 
My recommendation is stay away from this flat and if you do go for it, be ready to pay an extra £300 a month to cover bills and charges, more if you want to stay warm on cold winter days.",08-03-2021 01:26 PM,£1670

There was a burglary in 12-2015, burglar broke in through the rear door (see pictures of the lock broken and bedroom after the burglary). We were devastated and always felt unsafe - instead of getting the repairs done to the rear door, this was sealed for weeks - as this was a basement flat and the inability to open this door caused lot of discomfort for ventilation purposes - we finally decided to leave and hoped that the landlady would give us our deposit back - but Landlady is  looking to make deduction of £175/- for cleaning in spite of the house being cleaned professionally +  £200 for decoration (compensation) as there are 2 pen marks on the wall plus one of those sticky hooks. We left the house on 5th of Feb which was 13 days earlier than 2-months notice period - given the circumstances we should be allowed to do so as its difficult to stay in a burgled house with doors sealed off- Landlady is also claiming rent for these 13 days which is £800/-


We lived in the house without being able to open the rear door for weeks, had issues with dead ants between the floor in the summer which was grouted over, experienced condensation which was never resolved, got burgled and lost a fortune, moved out for 3 weeks so that landlady can carry out repairs and after all this inconvenience we are not being returned our deposit fully. We always paid our rent (£1700 a month) on time for this basement flat, took great care of it and deserve better treatment than this. 

We have now submitted a claim that we will not pay £375/- deductions from deposit and £800/- rent for 13 days as we never claimed rent compensation when landlady was repairing the kitchen and we had to move out for 3 weeks. We are awaiting the response. 

To summarise - one wrong renting decision can affect your life for years, tenants need to be very careful and share information on properties they rent to avoid mistakes being repeated by multiple tenants. I wished i could have shared all this information to tenants who were coming to view the property but i could not as they were with the agents and there was no opportunity to warn them.

1) The boiler does not work properly. The pressure drops periodically (about twice a week) and we had to work out ourselves how to increase the pressure to get hot water back. The landlord only told us about the problem at check-in and never fixed it.

2) We are a couple and were only provided with one set of keys. We had to get the other set cut at our own cost.

3) In the winter, homeless people enter the building and sleep in the corridors. They are very noisy and smelly. The building is not adequately secure, so in addition to homeless people, youths enter the flat and damage the stairwells with cigarettes, drugs and litter. The police came round frequently during the winter. I had to call them myself once.

4) The bathroom ventilation is bad, so mold is difficult to impossible to prevent. The shower screen  leaked badly when we moved in and it took the landlord months to fix.

5) We had a problem with pigeons for the first few months we were there. We weren\'t informed they were a pest problem when we moved in but they were. They lived on the balcony and made an extraordinary amount of mess, noise and damage. Told the landlord and the landlord did not reply to my email. Eventually pigeon netting was installed by the building management company, which solved the problem. Some areas of the building still do not have pigeon netting however, so excrement has piled up outside the front and in the car park.

6) There is a problem at the flats with rubbish dumping and fly tipping. Other residents do not put their litter in the bins provided and throw it over the car park floor. Other residents/landlords also fly tip old furniture (including beds, sofas and bath tubs) in the car park. This has caused a vermin problem (pigeons, mice, rats and flies). In particular the flies are bothersome and enter the flat. The bin men do not leave the bins nicely anymore and discard them in the car park because they are angry with the mess.

7) Most seriously of all, we are in a dispute with the landlord, who proposed deposit deductions in excess of £1200 for wear and tear, which they claim are \""extensive dilapidations\"" to the property.

Do not be fooled by the looks of the property being new for the following reasons:

- MAIN ROOM: Located right below the MAIN dining/day area of the landlord\'s house. Meaning, you will hear EVERY single foot step all day from 7am to 11pm (sounds like stomping when heels digging into the hardwood floors) basically until they got to bed. This is of course if they do not have guests over to entertain which is about 2 times per week and the \'\'soiree\'\' goes on until 2:00 a.m.
- KITCHEN HAS NO EXHAUST FAN: meaning, if you fancy cooking a small meal, forget it. The smoke alarm will go off even if you are making scrambled eggs. You have to either put a fan in there while cooking and open up the main Studio door to air our the place. There are 4 smoke detector for such a small living space
- BATHROOM HAS NO EXHAUST FAN: Flusher keeps running until you master the technique on how to push it so it stops. Flagged to the landlord various time. Done nothing about it and pointed out in a way that I did not know how to press the toilet flusher\'\' EXPECT mold in the bathroom as again no exhaust fan
- DEN: MOLD and CONDENSATION all over the walls top to bottom
- SALT PUMP SKIN DAMAGE: You will be provided on a monthly basis salt cubes/bags by the landlord to fill up the salt pump for the entire building. Enjoy your skin breaking out when showering due to salt. (see below shower head comment) Avoid renting if you have sensitive skin.
- OBSERVATIONS: Landlord (him and her) like to always oversee things, expect to be notified once a month to have access to the place. This is unfortunate as they live right above you. Landlord does not allow you to place bicycle outside against rail to not cause damage. IRONICALLY she places hers outside. She ran out out screaming at one of my guests who arrived. Basically landlord will be in your face everyday, all week and all year seeing what you are doing
- CHECKOUT: Expect to have the landlord nit pick at every single cm/inch of the property and good luck getting your deposit back. I looked after the entire property living there for a year. Had installed a shower filter to the shower head due to the high level of salt in water as my skin was breaking out. The chrome screw that attaches the filter to the shower head got scratched while fixing it with a wrench. Landlord demanded the entire shower head to be changed for GBP 250",05-02-2017 04:03 AM,£1580

Landlord could not find window manufacturer so beware, Room 1 will always have a cold draft. First month of moving in was extremely stressful as landlord only gave the contract to sign and protected my deposit after 30 days of moving in. He wouldn\'t respond or read messages for days and then call to argue about the window. After much complaining, landlord suggested I move out instead and a 6 month contract was agreed as a compromise instead of 1 year. 

No lock on Room 1 door - landlord said he would replace all doors but this was never fixed. Room 1 is directly opposite the front door so safety was a huge issue as door could not be locked from the outside. 

Landlord knocked on my door one evening and said tenants had complained about my shoe rack being in the hallway rather than in my room. On confronting each tenant, all three denied. Either landlord or tenants lied - very unhealthy atmosphere in the flat.

Mould in bathroom was never professionally cleaned. Flat had red ant infestation throughout the year in kitchen and bathrooms - nothing was done about it. Landlord took 3 days to fix clogged bathtub drain, meaning tenants had to bathe in dirty bath water for 3 days. Pipe in toilet burst and flooded flat below, landlord fixed it within 24 hours (compare with how long it took to fix a problem that only affected us and not others). Be warned - every time landlord visits, the boiler is found turned off. He did this during winter months which left us with no hot water/heating for hours until someone realised the boiler had been switched off.",02-06-2023 01:54 PM,£980

I\'ve been living here for 3 years, in that time I got to know well how things are going around here. The landlady is very relaxed about everything (except your rent) or at least it seemed to be in the beginning. Later I realized she\'s way too relaxed, it\'s rather negligence. Negligence all the way and if you have a complaint you get a bad response. I\'d use another words, but not allowed here so by \""bad response\"" you can imagine an angry women if you try to encourage her for getting stuff done. She doesn\'t care for your well-being, she doesn\'t really show up very often (which is good in a way, but ultimately shows she doesn\'t care at all), and just for short periods of time to collect rent.
I\'d say she\'s easygoing as long as you don\'t complain about anything at all and you accept her way. Otherwise you will face a \""if you don\'t like it you can leave\"" attitude. Even with easygoing long term tenants like myself: did only request the bare minimum maintenance over the years, like for a broken washing machine we had to beg for weeks, or I hear from previous tenant (who still lives here) that before I moved in the house didn\'t have a working gas heater for almost two winters. Now our new pain in our life is the poor internet. She changed the TalkTalk we had (which wasn\'t the greatest the begin with) to a 4 Mbit iTalk contract (which may be upgraded to 30 Mbit at the most, may not, still debating on this), and there\'re 5 people sharing this with numerous devices (yeah, good luck streaming anything at all, my messages won\'t even load in busy hours). All this to save her like 15-20 quid a month... And the 5 of us generates her around 2 grands pcm. So long story short we agreed to pay 5 quid each on top of our rent (should be all inclusive) for a usable internet connection. Yeah, so you can guess her response for questioning: take it or leave it.
But the leaking basin tap wasn\'t a problem for months. I bet we lost tons of water on than alone. But hey, who am I to judge? I leave it to the reader.

Side note: in this global pandemic when all of the UK went on mortgage holidays and pretty much all my friends had their rents significantly reduced, guess what? Here we payed full rent all along. Response was a straight no. No place for debate. Take it or leave it...
And now we\'re facing an increase straight after this period.

The house itself is poorly maintained, it could really use a full overhauling, but that\'s not gonna happen until it poses a safety hazard. Which of we already have some, like hanging electrical wires here and there, water leaks, etc. Other than that the property is full of the landlady\'s belongings, I\'d say it was properly cluttered almost like a hoarder\'s house. Since then we tidied the place up a bit (shoved everything in corners of the property we don\'t normally use, and got rid of some broken stuff we\'re sure it would never be used again).
Anyway I post a few pics for evidence, but in my honest opinion only those move in here in their right mind who are desperate. You can only find better places than this. It is good to have a roof above you, but you don\'t really get any more than that, let alone to call it \""home\"".
If you read this dear landlady, I hope you will be a better person in the future.",11-08-2020 07:26 AM,£440

When we moved in we were promised we could bring our own furniture and that they would remove some of the existing furniture for free. After we moved in they demanded a cost for this, we had to fight this and eventually they did as promised. 
We have had issues with loud building work in the building at unsociable hours (organised by Akelius), leaks and mould. They outsource maintenance to another company which have not totally fixed any faults we\'ve had.

Neither parties are very good at responding to issues in a prompt manner and it can take a very long time for repairs to be made. In one instance, we had no central heating for over 3 months, leading me to fix it myself on one particularly cold day. This led to false promises by the landlord to compensate for the time/effort, which never came to anything.
Another time, the light switch for the exterior light was causing an electric shock when touched. This also took months to resolve and was a clear health and safety issue.
It will be necessary to have a direct contact for the landlord as you will need to send chasers to him whenever the agency has failed to act on maintenance reports.
At the end of the tenancy, the agency becomes very pushy, attempting to dictate which days viewings are conducted. Obviously they do need to conduct viewings but they should respect that the tenants may have existing commitments and accept what \""slots\"" are provided.
Finally, if you are a tenant of theirs, be very careful at the end when they conduct viewings - make sure you are present and keep an eye on them. Money went missing off my desk when the agency did the last batch of viewings.",01-06-2023 10:16 AM,£850

Cons: 1. Already from the viewing I could see that they were not the most professional agency. Viewing was conducted aprox. 15 mins after scheduled time, by the cleaner (apparently the member of staff was off sick). Although the cleaner was nice, understanbly they were not in a position to answer any questions. Anyway, I decided to go with the property. 2. Signing up was alright, although there was extra paperwork involved since they required a guarantor despite me being in full-time employment. Also beware, our contract had a requirement for a 2-months notice 3. Also, I did not get a move-in date until the last minute and they didn\'t seem to care much about it. 4. The biggest issue arose when our property had to be completely rewired. Communication was awful from their side with their description of what had to be done changing almost daily. After long negotiations, the works went ahead and lasted for more than a week interrupting our working lives during COVID and leaving our place in a complete mess (see photos). We were also left with no carpets/laminate in one of the rooms and the landing for two-three months following the completion of the rewiring. On top of that, we received at least 4-5 emails/calls, and 3 visits by different workmen before the floor was finally reinstalled with carpet although the rest of the property had laminate. Similar issues with rewiring were faced by all of our neighbours (some elderly) at Pelham Place. 5. They requested a monthly increase of £55 after a year, at which point we (and some of our neighbours) decided to vacate 6. It took them more than a month to return our deposit. The landlord tried to claim £130 but their claims were so ridiculous that they had to drop them all after one rebuttal email. It is clear that the agency supports an opportunistic approach when it comes to deposits. Also, beware, their inventories are so very basic that they might leave you exposed at the end when they try and make claims. 6. Also, another word of caution, the agency will often claim that actions are ultimately up to the landlords, but in our case, at Pelham Place, the properties are actually owned by the immediate family 7. Staff turnover is bad and this only makes communication worse. Looking at Glassdoor comments you don\'t get the impression that staff are treated well. 8. If anything goes wrong, their reflexes are to blame the tenants. E.g. there was a leak at the shop below and we got a patronising call informing us that we should be more careful cleaning the balcony drains. It then turned out that the leak had nothing to do with us. 9. After we decided to vacate, they sent an email sort of asking how we wanted to go about with viewings but in a matter of a few hours, we had received notices of scheduled viewings showing how much they valued our opinion. In one case, we were also not given the legal 24-hour notice. Pros: 1. You do get some contacts for emergency repairs. Their contractors are very friendly but not always the most professional. 2. Their properties tend to be on the cheaper end, but once you deal with them, you understand why. 

The property itself is very sunny and warm and Chapel Allerton is very nice neighbourhood. Can get very noise on a Friday and Saturday night. Overall, we would not recommend the property because of the people that manage it. They are very profit orientated and don\'t respect their tenants.",21-11-2021 11:00 AM,£695

The flat has a few issues - very noisy main road is an obvious one. It is electrically heated and so expect very high bills - £300/month in winter.

Unfortunately the landlord was difficult to deal with - Initial work that was promised before the move in (to fix the shower and toilet) were not carried out.
A repetitive problem with the heating and toilet kept re-occurring I assume due to a reluctance to pay for a permanent fix.

Finally on check out a large sum was attempted to be deducted by the landlord despite the flat being handed back in excellent condition, long  delays in returning deposit also - it took many months.

The doors in bathroom and kitchen doesn\'t open completely, no shower curtain, sockets inside the closet in the master bedroom and the house was really dirty when we started living there...
We had a lot of problems with the letting agency, Marsh&Parsons. They told us (in an email) that if we left the property before the breaking clause we only had to pay 10% of the rest of the contract, but after signing the contract they told us that we had to pay the full amount. In another situation a person entered our home without noticing, opening the door with the keys they have. After complaining they told me that the person was cleaning and he entered the house by mistake. The hob broke in December and they took a month to repair it, so we couldn\'t cook during all Christmas.
Also, the agency was really quick to take our money, but it\'s been 3 weeks since we finished the contract and we still don\'t know about the refund of the deposit, we keep asking and they answer with evasives. 
To improve things, the neighbours told us that a couple of years before the ceiling of the house fell, because the house is really old. We have a baby and we don\'t want to take the risk of living there.

I was very excited to rent a 1 bed and move out of a house-share. And i agreed to pay an sizeable amount for this flat, which seemed in a nice building. Little did I know that i was not alone in the flat. The flat came infested with millions of bedbugs and i submitted photo proofs of them (including one of me being bitten all over). 

I recieved help after 2-3 days of living in that condition. Even then the issue was not solved as the landlord tried to for a cheaper solution rathen than the effective one. After weeks of complainig, i was asked to pack up all my belongings and let the bug terminators 4-6 weeks. please dont get surprised when the landlord expected me to leave the flat for 4-6 weeks and expected me to pay in full. After much negotiation, we agreed on landlord waiving the rent for 4 weeks. 

And just when i thought i was getting comfortable, the ceiling started leaking. Again after many cut paste cheap jobs and weeks later, when the problem wasnt solved, i was asked to not use electricity in the living room. Basically not occupy it as the water interfered with electricity. And was asked to pay the rent in full, despite not being able to use the flat in full. Reason cited was i still have a bed to sleep in. This went on for anther 4-5 weeks and despite trying to seek legal help, i was told that the agreement was drawn in favor of the landlord. Meaning, the landlord tried to help! Had he not tried to help, the legal case would have been stronger. However, since he tried to help, despite it taking 6 + weeks, i had to pay the full rent.

When I had the room viewing, he lied about gas functionality (said it is working fine), and did not mention we are actually 10 people in the house. The house does not have a living room, yet the rent is unusually high for the state of the premises - £700 (bills and cleaning services included).
We had no lights on the top floor, there was no gas, so no hot water in the kitchen or sink/washbasin. 
We also could not use the top floor shower as there was no gas to heat the water so all the tenants in the house (10-11 people in total) had to extensively use a single shower which was impossible in the morning rush hour or in the evening after work. The noise from the heavy traffic on the main street nearby, as well as the voices/bangs from the neighbours rooms were often disturbing. There was also a kitchen tap leakage he did not fix at all
TV was not working at all when I moved in and the landlord failed to fix it in the first 2 months. This was fixed  only in July (2 months after I moved in) for a few days, but we had to change the broadband & TV supplier and this process took us 3 weeks during which we had no broadband and I could not use the TV at all. 
Rent was £700 each month including cleaning services and bills (which according to the tenancy agreement, these should be: electricity, gas, broadband).
The landlord did not make sure the kitchen and shower are cleaned each week, so we had the house dirty for several weeks in a row in July and September and the shower was clogged, the water could not drain properly down the pipe and so there was a flood in the bathroom we had to deal with as tenants. We were lucky enough with us as the water was removed in time so it won\'t cause any damage to Headmasters downstairs. Every other tenant in the house were unhappy and some were complaining that the landlord doesn\'t take responsibility of his own property. 
Additionally, one of the tenants (who lives there with his sister in the same room) had a bad tenant behaviour by making a lot of noise in his room, the mirror was toothpaste spit by him in the toilet, and he even managed in some way to burn his food in the kitchen oven two times, which generated a lot of smoke. When challenged, he did not admit he made all this mess (except for the smoke).
The landlord  failed to fix so many things during my tenancy. I should have notified the council straight away when I moved in but I was a gentle person not to do this as I was hoping he will fix them in a reasonable amount of time. 
At the end of the tenancy, the landlord came only after I vacated the room and seemed quiet for one week during which he did not return any part of my deposit. After this one week he made up accusations that I have not ventilated the room before vacating (even though I have opened the window one hour before I left), and \'heavily scratched\' the desk (which is untrue - only a normal wear of the desk discolouration as a small patch is present). Also, he claimed I did not pay the rent before the agreed payment date (28th of each month), which is also untrue as I have made all the rent payments by internet banking in his account at least one day in advance. For these things he claimed ridiculous charges of £80 in total, and therefore he returned only £620 out of £700 as deposit refund. He did not protect my deposit using a government scheme, which I found out only after I moved out. 
My feeling is that he is doing this intentionally only to benefit from tenant\'s deposit and invoke false accusations so that he can charge in the end the amount he wishes to. Even though I sent him numerous emails explaining he is not right and he should better return the outstanding deposit, he refuses to admit I am right, he reject all my phone calls and gives me vague answers when I challenged him to send me any evidence for the charges he claimed.
He showed an irresponsible/complacent behaviour throughout my entire tenancy and would personally not recommend at all this property.",29-10-2017 06:57 AM,£700

The landlady lets you manage it independently and calls rarely. It is overall a nice place to live. However the property is not well maintained. I lived there for a few years and no works were ever carried out; the house is quite old and it is clear that nothing was done for ages, before or during our stay: very old stinky carpets never replaced [asked me to do it if I wanted new carpets], walls never painted, fridge broke and we were given a used one, etc. The house could be lovely but looks shabby and old. Also, it used to take ages for the landlady to carry out repairs when something got broken. We ended up fixing some things ourselves and only reported a few repairs during those years.

Unsurprisingly within a couple of days of us moving out the property was back up for rent at an increase of 25%. We were paying £875 a month & they now want £1150. Utterly disgusting. Property is full of mould & damp on virtually every outside wall. Boiler losses pressure so often that you have to repressurise it monthly. Before we moved in they\'d allowed a dog to wee all over the carpets & it stunk. Took them nearly 2 months to replace the carpets which when taken up made the fitter gip due to the smell. Landlord tries to fix things himself & he\'s not very bright. Lovely area but definitely wouldn\'t pay over £850 unless problems were sorted. Bathroom only has a small window & virtually impossible to get it free from mould. Double glazing in living room has failed as condensation permanently present. Requires replacing all the seals.

I experienced the following issues from the outset:

No contract - I was given a single piece of paper covering payment, exit, and cleaning, with meagre details about house rules. I asked for a contract and was refused one.

House rules were explained on a walkaround with the landlady, constituting a verbal agreement.  Later in the year the rules were changed arbitrarily and without my agreement, as is required under a verbal contract. For example, cooking after 9pm was initially allowed but a curfew was later imposed.

I was subject to harassment and bullying by the landlady - for example, I often received angry texts about minor infractions blamed on myself. I was routinely told my room smelled, though it suffered from damp and had not been cleaned from the previous tenant. I was ordered to leave my window room open when I went out, constituting a fire/burglary risk. The landlady routinely went into my room, meaning I had no privacy, and harassed me about tidiness and my personal possessions.

The room itself was well turned-out, with a double bed, wardrobe, desk and chair, lamp, and chest of drawers. However, the room had a squeaky laminate floor that caused echoes and loud sounds beyond my control; these also became a source of harassing comments. There was also no lock on the door.

This is not a good house for someone with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues: the landlady and landlord had no awareness about such conditions, which became a factor in the bullying and harassment. 

The atmosphere in the house was often stressful. Incidents of the landlady harassing myself often took place in front of others, including her daughter. Unexpected guests were common; for three months a homeless man was given shelter until he stole money from one of the bedrooms. This contributed to a general unsafe atmosphere.

On leaving the house I was unfairly charged for replacement furniture. I contested this successfully but had to threaten legal action to do so, which likely would not have happened had a formal contract existed between myself and the landpersons.",03-12-2017 10:36 AM,£0

1. The apartment is well-ventilated and has enough natural light. In winter, the living room and small bedroom get direct sunlight for a couple of hours which is helpful. However, the master bedroom doesn\'t get direct sunlight due to direction/angle. 
2. It is close to the main road and the bus stop (1-minute walk to the bus stop) and the bus frequency to go to oxford centre is good on most days/times. It is very quiet in spite of being close to the main road.
3. The view from the windows is pleasant. 
4. Open layout of the kitchen/dining area/living room gives the house a very spacious feeling. 

The Bad:
1. The bathrooms/toilets are carpeted. This makes cleaning toilets and bathrooms a very difficult process wasting 1 hour every weekend as you have to clean without letting the water fall out. If excess water falls, it leads to mould in the carpet which can be very very difficult to remove. Any toilet accidents (if you have small kids or guests with poor aim :p ) can again lead to major problems in maintenance. Our request to change the flooring inside the bathrooms was denied by the landlord. 

2. The landlord is quite unresponsive. We requested a change of dining chairs (they were in very poor condition since the start of our let, and by mid-tenure, had become unusable). The requests had to be routed through the lettings agent. After we raised the request, the agent got back to us after 1 month asking for more details. After we furnished the details, the agency never got back to us and never replaced the chairs. 

3. Its been 2 months+ since we left the apartment but we still have not received our deposit back. The landlord/agent informed us about proposed discussions after 4 weeks after our vacating the place. When we countered the offer, the landlord/lettings agent has again not responded to our counter for 4 weeks. This is in spite of our constant reminders to speed the process. 

4. The under-the-floor heating provided in this apartment is absolutely useless  (ineffective and costly). It takes 2-2.5 hours after we turn on the heating for the room to start getting to a comfortable temperature. This means we need to keep the heater on for longer period (leading to higher cost) and when we are feeling cold, there is no immediate relief that we can hope for from heaters. 

5. The building maintenance company is equally unresponsive. The garbage bins provided are not sufficient for the number of flats they cater to. This means the bins are often overflowing make the bin shed very dirty. Inspite of multiple complaints to building maintenance, they rarely take action to fix the problem. This lack of attention from them has been raised by other tenants in the building too.",24-12-2022 07:29 AM,£1350

I rented this property one year ago, which is by one main train line and I will never do that again as the noise is constant and too loud (my bad), specially with cargo trains even through the night and early morning (e.g. 4:00am), being forced to sleep with earplugs the whole year. Also, the entire house vibrates when a train comes by, not dramatically, but you can feel it. Apart from that, the property is quite spacious and bright most of the time and it has a nice garden, but again I did not enjoy because of the noise. The neighborhood is completely safe though.

Similarly, when we moved in there were a few things broken or that needed to be replaced like light bulbs, exterior lights, hot water tap and the fire alarm did not have any battery fitted!! It looked that the landlord did not care too much about what was going on around the house. In addition, the double glazed window in the bedroom (Velux) was broken, which means that one of the glasses was not properly sealed and it did not sit properly on the frame, so I would have frozen in winter, but thanks to the adhesive sealing for windows that you can buy at any DIY shop I could keep it reasonably warm (high gas bill). By the way, all the windows are wooden ones and single glazed!!. Moreover, there was a bent pipe beneath the sink and we had to fight, even threat, the landlord to get it repaired after a few months, although he was trying to blame us for that. To summarize, the property needs a big refurbishment because I could go on all day talking about these things.

Focusing on the landlord, he has not been very helpful and he has avoided his responsibilities till the last minute. Also, when he showed us the property he looked in a rush because he knows about the train and he also gave misleading information about the frequency of the them. In conclusion, I would not trust him.

Overall, an overpriced property for its location and also the landlord has not done anything to decrease the nuisance of the train in years and based on my experience he will not do it, even if he tells you that he will. Another case of money grabbing around Oxfordshire, as it is being advertised for higher price after I moved out and no improvements has been undertaken at all, however there are good landlords too. Piece of advice, the further you live from Oxford the better quality of life you are going to have in every aspect (i.e. cheaper rent and newer houses)

I hope it helps somebody.

Kind regards,

We also received a message where we were bulleyed  by them for a simple reason of not receiving their call when they tried ringing us on their first attempt auctioned between a span of 2-3 minutes and message following very next. We gave them a notice period of 3 months and they seemed to be very uncivilised in their behaviour - where if they raised their voice and cut us in between it was moral but if we did that in response(every actions has an equal reaction)  it was disrespect. The landlord has traditional temporary ways of fixing things and to end it on a good note I usually did give a good end to it in conversations we had but the furniture he provided from a perfect condition came down to a Useable condition ( again he decides what is perfect and useable) we even asked them to change the mattress and discard furniture  but they didn’t change where we even mentioned we will Pay for the mattress and sofa ourselves. Absolutely ended not like we expected. Now they want money from our deposit to provide a new tenant with a brand new mattress and to clean the apartment fully again. Waste of our time but we will go the lengthy process of dps as our money is hard earned. Also very heavy mould and condensation issues in this flat. The flat is also very close to the pipe and because it is a corner flat the toilet cleaner told us clogging might only affect us mainly and we had a flood of toilet water and shit oozing out on the floor directed towards living room and bedroom as well.,28-02-2021 01:35 PM,£900

The landlord had asked us to vacate the property on the 1st of October 2019 as he wanted the property to be empty, to sell it faster. The house had been on the market since 10th of May 2019 and was being marketed by Purplebricks. However we were unable to vacate the property by the 1st of October as our next property wasn’t going to be ready till the 25th of October 2019 and asked him to grant us an extension of the date to vacate the property. He said he was planning to move into the property himself and will only allow us to stay on in the property till the 25th of October if we paid him £2500 plus the rent till the 1st of November 2019,in cash . My husband is a doctor in the NHS and £2500 is quite a big amount of money for us, whereas the landlord is a rich businessman. Even then he took £2500 from us saying he needed to pay his removal company All Moves £2200, and £300 to his cleaners and that the amount was non-refundable and couldn’t be cancelled. He couldn’t postpone the removals and cleaners to a later date either, which we thought was highly irregular as we know from experience, having used a lot of these removal companies, that it is possible to postpone the removal dates. 

             We agreed to pay the money to him on the condition that he will forward the removal and cleaner receipts to us, which he promised to do. However in spite of asking him many times for the receipts since then, we haven’t got them as yet. He hasn\'t refunded the money back to us either in spite of my asking him innumerable times to refund the £2500 back to us. I have complained to the estate agent, Purplebricks but they weren\'t at all interested in acting on my complaint and stopped taking my calls regarding my complaint.

What really shocks me is how easily the landlord defrauded us without any regard for tenancy laws, criminal or civil laws of England. He was very sure that he could get away with it. He has absolutely no conscience whatsoever and no regard for his tenants. We have lived in many rental properties and almost all of them have been pleasant experiences, barring 2 Petunia Close which has been an unsavoury experience right from the start of the tenancy.",26-04-2020 08:53 PM,£1150

As a group they are poorly informed of proper contracting and tenants rights so please read your contract very thoroughly before signing here as it contains contradictions, ambiguous statements and contradictions of tenant rights. In addition they are very slow to make repairs and very quick to assign blame to the tenants for issues the tenants have not caused. When moving in, I paid the deposit as stipulated then the day before moving was texted to ask for the first months rent in cash the following morning. This should either have been requested at the time of contract signing, or, as stipulated by the unclear contract was not owed at all. The daughter refused to give me the keys until I had handed over the money (at this point I had no idea who she was and had not previously met her) and stated that as I was unable to withdraw this much cash in one go she \""did not trust\"" me and \""felt like not giving me the keys at all\"". She was over an hour late to bring the keys and by the time she agreed to hand the keys over (having had to transfer money to the landlord and wait for him to call her to confirm) I had less than an hour to move my things form the neighbouring town.
Subsequently every dealing with the daughter she has been abrupt, not bothered to communicate with all tenants or simply come into the property without written notice.
The landlords stated that there were 3 parking spaces but only 2 tenants with cars. In fact they had let knowingly to 4 tenants with cars leaving one to purchase a permit elsewhere.
I addition, all tenants are currently paying different rates for their room, not contingent on size or furnishing. One tenant was informed they have a private bathroom so had to pay more rent, which the other tenants were told is communal. The individual in the smallest and noisiest room is paying the highest rate of rent at present, nearly £100 more than others.
Early in the tenancy the daughter\'s husband would enter the property weekly provisionally to check the fire alarm (which was not done) and would check through all communal areas. Tenants were informed there was a cleaner who attended to communal areas weekly, there is no cleaner.
The tenants have all been asked in January whether they wished to retain their room next year, with the exception of one tenant. When this tenant found out and emailed the landlord to say the were undecided but would be able to confirm at least 2 months before the end of the tenancy, they were told their room was being advertised as they needed a firm response. This tenant received no formal notice that their contract is not being renewed but room viewings have already been arranged.
In general, the landlords and daughter have been difficult, unprofessional and rude. This is sad as the house itself is a good size and reasonably priced, it just is not worth the grief.",23-02-2017 04:23 AM,£0

Rats in the wall, a rat died and rotted and led us to shut off half of the flat for 3 weeks. Nightly scratching and nibbling next to your head in bed. Bonus cockroaches in winter.

The thudding bass from the hair dressers downstairs goes from 9am - 6/9pm every day apart from Sunday and Monday. Lying in bed or on the sofa is impossible during these times. God forbid we had a child. The walls were vibrating before we taught the owner how to turn the bass down. But we still got woken up on a Saturday in bed by pop music most Saturday mornings. 

The next door neighbours toilet window, and the Indian takeaways kitchen window, are both right next to the two bedroom windows. If you want your window open in summer, you’ll fall asleep to the sound of clashing pans and yelling, be woken up by their end of work showers, and be woken the next morning by the horrible sounds of the very sweary and loud roommate taking his morning toilet trip. The extractor fan of the kitchen, also right next to the bedroom windows, means that the flat smells of curry 4pm until 11pm every day like clockwork. 

The bus stop outside is an end of line, and during the summer buses run and rev their engines so hard that the living room fills with fumes and deafening noise.

Our downstairs neighbours were plagued with black mould and soggy ceilings. Luckily we had no problems with this.

Crossed wires on the payment meter for us and downstairs means that no one knows who owes what for electricity. The administrative incompetence of the office was probably initially to blame, and then just confused things further and further.

It’s all brand new fixtures and fittings, and all of them work really well. But as those basic range B&Q fittings get older, it’s going to be hard to find anything to like about this flat. Add to that the confusing and sometimes distressing level of incompetence from the office of Cantel/MJ properties, and it’s just not a place to even consider.

They don\'t care about tenants or repairs and issues you raise. I have been told that in order to move on cannot register with home options for 2 years-they keep blocking me; and to reregister on home swappers again as no one will accept responsibility for the muck up as regards tenancy.  I would not recommend anyone to consider EMH homes when looking for somewhere the tenants have no respect for the neighbours constantly banging doors dragging furnishings and shouting and screaming in their flat.  EMH have done nothing as regards these and other issues like all night parties with music blasting till 6am daily hence why other previous tenants have done the equivalent of a moonlight flit moving in to either private rental or via another housing organisation.,16-01-2017 07:02 PM,£0

He waited to tell me at my door. On the tenancy agreement it is specific to whether you lose or damage your key nothing about whether you lock yourself out. 
When my tenancy came to an end they wanted to charge me £100 for the cleaning fee even though I left the room clean all except a but of rubbish that I had missed on the opposite side of my bed I hoovered the room wiped down everything including the microwave and fridge left the bathroom spotless so I was disgusted that they were going to try and swindle £100 out of me for putting a but of rubbish in the bin

Thank God for DPS I disputed their claim to take £250 out of my deposit

And DPS confirmed that they agreed so for the cleaning fee the DPS awarded the letting company £10 because they could not see any evidence that the room needed £100 worth of cleaning.
When it came to the call out fee to let me back in my room after locking myself out the DPS rewarded the letting company £30 because they could not see a 5 minute walk for someone to come and let you back into your room is equivalent to the charge of £150 

The DPS actually used the phrase “penal in nature” in regards to charging me £150 to let me back into my room

I advice EVERYONE whoever locks them self out of their room while living here to dispute that fee straight away because it is absolutely disgusting 

I am relieved that the DPS was able to prevent me from been unjustly charged and if the letting company happen to come across this review I hope they take the advice of the DPS and be fair and charge current tenants the same amount of £30 as advised by DPS should they lock themselves out and return £120 to tenants who have clearly been vastly over charged for locking themselves out of their room",03-07-2020 12:41 PM,£745

The plus sides of renting this place are:
- fitted with a new boiler
- the second bedroom is decent sized
- the bathroom and the kitchen are large enough
- close to the city center
- the area is generally safe
- it\'s ideal for sharers or students who just want to be close to the city center and don\'t spend a lot of time at home

The downsides are:
- bathroom started leaking inside the kitchen through the kitchen ceiling (there is a crack and sometimes we found water drips on the kitchen floor)
- double glazing is not as it should. One set of windows opens from bottom to top and the other set opens from left to right. The actual opening is a very small square composed of the opening intersection of both sets of windows. This makes mold appear. One of the bedrooms and the living room are never ventilated properly (actually the living room has no windows that can be opened).
- it would be nice if the bathroom would have a bathtub with a shower. Right now there is a transparent wall near the shower which makes it very difficult to reach the showerhead if you\'re not actually in the shower.
- window bathroom is also sealed and this encourages mold appearance very often
- a factor that could improve reduced humidity inside the house, could be a tumble dryer, but after having a discussion with the Landlord and her brother (who was against the tumble dryer), they suggested that the laundry could be dried outside, near the house where you would normally park your car. So it\'s either a car or clothes dried outside.
- I would suggest that you ask to speak only to the Landlord (Lee Ann) and avoid discussions with her brother as he is a bit unaware of how the tenancy should be managed but has strong opinions. His suggestion was to clean up the leaves outside the property and put it in the Garden Waste bin, place it outside when the trash day is due and someone will collect it.  The Garden Waste collection, at least in Birmingham, works by having a subscription that costs 40 pounds/year. That would have been a piece of valuable information before I filled up the bin and found out that no one will collect it. 
Also, he said that the property is in a good area and that we must \""keep the standards up\"". I\'m sorry that I  don\'t have a photo of the garbage that people throw on the street in front of the house when they are going to the garages (which don\'t appear in any photos of the house)  near the house.
In fact, it\'s such a good area that a land mower, a rake, and a shovel were stollen from the place near the house where we were supposed to dry or clothes or park the car.
- I would not recommend it for people with small children (families), as it gets a bit cold in the autumn/winter and even if the boiler is at maximum, rooms are not heating up enough (at least from my point of view).
- The carpet is old and needs replacement and so do the windows
- My opinion is that is overpriced",31-10-2019 05:41 AM,£900

Most of the issues have been repaired over the space of several weeks since the moving in date, causing inconvenience. Some of the issues have not been sorted, and I had to spend my time and money on them. 
The property has been empty for a long time before I moved in, therefore the problems reported below should have been found and fixed before the start of the tenancy. I personally consider the letting agents responsible for a poor inspection. 
1. The kitchen wall units doors were loose and at risk of falling off. After a few months, they have been repaired but the contractor appointed caused ulterior damage and I had to spend money myself to carry an emergency repair, to avoid damages and/or harm. I will update this post when and if I will be reimbursed for this.
2. The extractor fan\'s buttons were melted. 
3. The oven was broken. 
4. There was a leak from a clearly damaged, rusty pipe. 
5. I was promised for some of the walls to be repainted and that never happened. 
6. Several light bulbs were broken (from the moving in date). 
7. The dishwasher was broken, and it\'s still not been repaired after almost three months since the moving in date. I will update this when and if the appliance will be repaired/replaced.
8. The landlord is not responsive and that has been very inconvenient when I have requested for some of his belongings to be removed from the property, which I had to remove myself after weeks of waiting. 

If you are going to rent this property, ask the agent to let you inspect all the appliances, pipes, switches, plugs, doors, basically everything.
And if there are problems, ask for these to be fixed before the moving in date, and request a second visit to the property to check that everything has been sorted before paying the deposit and rent.

It\'s fixed. There will occasionally be some condensation in some of the rooms but nothing opening a window for 5 minutes can\'t fix.

Regarding the bug issue - some woodlice every now and again, but since house spiders moved into the basement we haven\'t seen a woodlouse since. House spiders themselves aren\'t an issue at all -  they don\'t bite, they very, very rarely come out and when they do it\'s super-easy to catch them and put them back in the basement. Just don\'t kill them - they help keep woodlice and other insects at bay. These kinds of problems are very common in old, refurbished terraced houses so just treat putting house spiders in your basement as a normal thing to do. Once they kill all insects they\'ll simply move on to the next house and leave you be.

The noise issue is mostly down to the neighbours - there is a great rotation of tenants in some houses and some of them aren\'t very considerate, especially on the weekends. The noisiest ones tend to move out pretty quickly though so you can have your windows open most of the year if you like. The neighbours we had when we were moving out were very nice and decent family people so hopefully it\'ll stay that way for a while.

Now, about our landlord: The area we chose to live in isn\'t the safest or the most pleasant of neighbourhoods, but our landlord made us feel welcome and made sure we had everything we needed to get us started in our new lives. We thought we would move to a nicer neighbourhood after a while but we ended up staying for almost 6 years. The landlord responded to our calls, fixed our problems promptly and professionally and was very courteous and polite too. He fixed us up with a new boiler, new washing machine, and helped us greatly in many aspects over the years. Hands down the best landlord I\'ve come across in my life. Lord knows Armley isn\'t the greatest place to live on this planet, but he helped us make it our home for 6 years of our lives. Armley (and the rest of the world for that matter) desperately needs more landlords like him.",15-05-2017 12:58 PM,£390

We experienced nothing but inconveniences regarding the overall state, maintainance and the landlady&#39;s way of managing. Some leakages were dealt with quickly, but given the amount of leakages (8) during a 2 month tenancy that is hardly positive.  According to the landlady the leakges are due to extreme weather and an old roof. Interestingly, the roof is old due to bad maintainance and extreme weather ( what she really means is &#39;any above average amount of rain&#39; ) is such a thing a roof should be able to be protective against. Also, being the only house in this  street in such a state, this says more about the landady&#39;s bank account then the age of this terraced house.

Even before we moved in there were issues, the landlord would pressure us to sign things instantly and we had to do anything he said as soon as he said it. But whenever we needed something or asked questions it would take days to hear anything back even though they had seen the messages, and even then, sometimes we got nothing back. 
The landlord leaves critical information from tenants to gain as much money as possible, doesn\'t supply tenants with proper service, we never received and inventory list or were told which service our deposit was being held in despite asking multiple times. 
As tenants with no help or communication we tried our best to resolve problems ourselves, during the winter time there was issues with the thermostat, we informed the landlord and no help was provided for weeks until he told us to try something to which it continued to stop working, at this point he finally sent someone to fix it then blamed is for the damages. We explained that it was already broken and we received no help for it but then were blamed after he told us to sort it ourselves. 
There have been many instances where we have been blamed for things after informing them weeks prior. It would seem they ignore us in hopes it gets worse and then can blame us for it and take full deposit.

During our tenancy, it had an antiquated gravity system, with a water tank in the loft and an old boiler. The gravity system means very poor water pressure in the main bathroom (the en-suite has an extra water) pump. Heating also broke down twice during last year, once because of a faulty diverter valve, and the other time because of a boiler issue. The old boiler is coupled with a programmer for heating and hot water - cumbersome to use and quite inefficient in terms of higher energy bills. There was also a water leakage that took very long to find and fix.

The agents and the landlord made a completely unjustified claim on the deposit (a dispute is currently in progress) - they claimed cleaning costs north of £150 (we spent £225 on professional cleaners at the end of tenancy) and similar amount for something called \""rubbish removal\"", which they didn\'t explain what exactly it meant. The landlord also claimed £150 for broken blinds, even though the blinds were not new before the start of the tenancy and can\'t be expected to last for too long.

Overall, the response time by agents to maintenance issues was OK but because they needed to consult the landlord on everything, most of the issues took much longer to get fixed than would have been necessary otherwise. My advice to the landlord would be to invest into renovating plumbing and heating systems (like, upgrade to a combi boiler) in the property instead of replacing the windows and fixing the fascia - the tenants likely care much more about how it feels inside the property and can tolerate not-so-shiny looks from the outside but not when there\'s no hot water and heating during the winter time.",17-05-2018 07:35 AM,£1660

The boiler also wasn\'t working properly since I moved in and took 4 months to sort out after contacting the landlords on more that one occasion.
When I moved in, my housemate told me that one of the tapes in the bathroom sink did not work and she had been complaining about it to the landlord for 2 months - it took another month to get fixed.
The house also has a damp problem - especially in the bathroom, where there is no shower curtain or tiles on the walls. The landlord has refused to sort this out despite the bathroom wall started crumbling - however, they did give us permission to sort this out ourselves. 
In December, the bathroom light started playing up. It would stay switched for a while (varies between seconds and minutes) and then would trip the light fuse causing the lights in the flat to go off. We\'ve complained about this on various occasions with nothing really being sorted out (the landlord would send someone over without warning so we couldn\'t be in the house but nothing would be fixed).

The main complaints I have are that we were great tenants, looked after the place but still got taken advantage of because we\'re young and the landlord has some sort of god complex. 

There was mould all around the flat when we first moved in due to a leak in the bathroom. However, rather than dealing with the issue (even when we told them we have asthma), the landlord made us wait 4 weeks to evaluate (after the leak was stopped). Then they waited another 2 weeks and simply wiped the mould away with vinegar (which left an unpleasant smell for a while). Then they said they won\'t do anything until the summer even though behind the toilet, where the leak was, there is a large amount of mould.

Additionally, the furniture is very basic. Beds are terrible and hurt our backs as they\'re so thin so we had to buy mattress toppers.

The local area always has police / ambulance around either driving past or actually taping the area up due to serious crime (3 times in 6 months). 

It\'s just not worth the hassle dealing with this abrasive landlord. I\'m pretty convinced now she\'s not human.

Other than all that, the flat is relatively nice. Not worth the hassle and cost in my opinion though.",29-11-2016 07:19 AM,£1660

For example during viewing there was basic garden maintenance equipment in the shed (lawnmower and other items), at no point was it mentioned that this would be removed, yet move in and despite it being listed on the inventory it wasn’t there.

The property suffers from severe noise and traffic pollution as the rear of the property backs onto the road to a busy Tescos, further Tesco delivery artic trucks park up opposite while queuing for their drop off at unsocial hours, with the engines on to power the chillers on the truck.

There is a very abusive and anti social resident living next door, her children often decide to walk down the passageway between the houses, however the passageway only provides access to my property.

The house has a driveway but the same problematic neighbours block my driveway constantly, instead of parking across or on their own drive.

It is a fairly high crime area, and I have been the victim of at least one attempted burglary whereby the rear gate of the property was attempted to be forced open.

The landlords are a nightmare to deal with, and I have been left with no heating at all when the temperatures were sub zero outside due to the unreliability of the heating, and poor quality insulation resulting in astronomical heating bills.  It appears that no work has ever been done to improve the insulation since the property was built in the 90s.

The property is opposite a residential nursing home for people with extreme learning disabilities so do expect lots of shouting and noise at all hours and that is far worse in summer whenever you have the windows open.

Next door regularly park obscuring the driveway despite them having space for two cars on the drive.  Not so good when you need to get anywhere.

The concept of ‘peaceful enjoyment of the property’ is a concept unknown to the landlords, the same with visiting the property, and are known for visiting the property without any notice.  They have just randomly turned up at the property on multiple occasions.

The side access to the property is insecure as the landlords decided to cut the entire gate closure mechanism off mid tenancy, therefore the property is far less secure and that anyone could gain access to the rear and side of the property at any time they want.

When you point out the unlawful actions of the landlords they retaliate by making malicious and false police reports, I suspect to try to create grounds to evict, however as expected, as I had not in fact done anything wrong that the matter was closed with no action.

I have had to make police reports in my time at living at the property for burglary and criminal damage, noise nuisance complaints to the council, and now complaints for the landlords harassment.

In my time at the property the landlords rent the property out by a professional agent, however that is where professionalism comes to an end, as the landlords then try to manage the property themselves and are fairly clueless as to their legal obligations as a landlord and will visit the property without any notice.

In summary, if you enjoy noise, problematic neighbours, landlords who make malicious false reports to police, shouting and screaming from a nursing home, crime, children playing on your driveway, your car being blocked in on your own driveway, fumes and traffic noise from the local Tesco then this property is ideal! If you wish for a peaceful and enjoyable property, one in which the heating works, one with reasonable landlords then look elsewhere!",10-09-2023 09:02 AM,

Could not recommend current landlord in this property enough! Throughout my years of renting, he is the most helpful, decent and caring landlord who made sure the flat was \""habitable in the highest standards\"" and ensured health & safety of his tenants were priority. Any problems (i.e. no water, he fixed straightaway. Like immediately!). He lets out properties in Kingston & Canary Wharf - whoever rents from him is lucky as he does look after you if any issues. Worth the money.

I moved into this property in July 2013. The location is excellent, 2 minutes walk to the station, 5 minutes walk to the town centre & riverside and countless bus stations to destinations like Heathrow, Wimbledon, Putney, Hampton Court, etc., so very accessible. 

Back then, we had a really terrible landlord (will now be referred to as TL). When the room was let out, it was dusty and the curtain rails were not attached to the wall properly. There was also live wiring from a light fitting socket which was left in the room. We also had constant problems with having no water which took at least a week to fix, and this happened several times throughout 2013-early 2015. When he was in the process of selling the property, he also did not inform tenants the estate agents were coming over which resulted in viewings unknown to the tenants and agents bursting into our room. I had learnt that from one of the tenants when she moved out that TL had not even protected the deposit! 

THIS ALL CHANGED in the 2nd half of 2015 when we acquired our new landlord (will now be referred to as NL). NL messaged existing tenants to arrange a meeting and to check everything is okay with the flat. He arranged for an electrician to sort our exposed live wire in one of the rooms and made sure that all electrics were safe and not in danger of bursting into flames. He also made sure that any damages (such as unsecured, hanging curtain rail) in the room was fixed. NL made sure that the existing tenants were living in a good condition flat. When we had no water again, he was immediately around to fix it. The issue has not occurred since! We signed new contracts with him, all paperwork were clear and if anything looked after the tenants interest. An email followed shortly from mydeposits.co.uk (a government authorised tenancy deposit protection scheme) to confirm that our deposits are now protected. NL already 5* service and he\'s only just taken over the property at this point! A year on, just before I left, we had a problem with the washing machine. Again, as quick as Flash, he was around there to check it out and have it fixed to make sure we could use it ASAP. 

I\'m so grateful to NL that he has looked after me as a tenant. A year & few months on, I have moved out and even then he made sure move out process was okay & deposit quickly returned after inspection. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CURRENT LANDLORD AT THIS PROPERTY. HE IS FANTASTIC!",01-09-2016 04:37 AM,£600

They served us a section 21 as we didn\'t agree to a rent increase, they didn\'t even bother to discuss with us directly and went straight to hiding behind the letting agent. The reason we didn\'t agree to a rent increase was because they left us, during the coldest part of winter when it was hitting -5 overnight, without a properly working boiler for over 1 month. They kept sending the plumber to try and fix it in the cheapest way possible and in the meantime offered us no alternatives such as space heaters. It costs us a fortune to buy and run them to keep ourselves just a little more than freezing. They never even apologised, just expected a big thanks when they finally replaced it and even lied about how much they spent on the new boiler for reasons unknown. So after serving us notice they then have the audacity to come and measure up for a new kitchen for the new tenants whilst we were still there. Then came getting the deposit back when we left, which we did well within the notice period and without fuss, even leaving the place frankly cleaner than it was when we moved in. We chased and chased for our deposit, as did the letting agent (supposedly), as did the deposit scheme. They completely ignored everything meaning we were out of pocket over 1k for over 2 months until the deposit scheme sent it back to us. Kicking us out of our home wasn\'t enough for these people but they, again for reasons unknown, purposely withheld our deposit from us.",26-10-2023 07:25 AM,£1000

The carpets in the lounge and hall were at least thirty years old, the kitchen units were of the same age and there was no cooker. There was also a shortage of electric sockets, only one in the kitchen. I was not concerned as the landlord agreed to my bringing my two giant dogs and the cat. He did put in fencing at the back and side, especially for the dogs, which I appreciated. I had to put the fence on the other side in myself. 

The radiators did not turn off individually so I found I was heating rooms I was not using; the heating system was very dated and inefficient. However, the problems I had with the landlord were mostly with the boiler and the drains. Nobody told me that an oil boiler, if allowed to run right out, would not light again. The landlord did repairs himself and was very aggressive, insisting that I had been told about this; I hadn\'t. I was there for two and a half years and the boiler was never serviced. 

The drains blocked within two weeks of my moving in. I was told the landlords wouldn\'t pay to clear them as they were checked before I moved in. The plumber who came, at my expense, said it was just normal sewage. A few weeks later, the drains blocked again. This time I got Dynorod, again at my expense, who said the problem was caused by the pipes being diverted from a cesspit to the main sewer. Every time the landlord visited for anything, he checked the drains, but still denied there was a problem with them. When I left he tried to claim £100 for blocked drains, although they were certainly not blocked when I left. He lied about that, saying I had been putting baby wipes down there; I hadn\'t. He also denied that I had permission to keep a cat and said he didn\'t know about the cat, despite having seen her several times. I asked the agent when I moved in about the animals being included on the lease and was told it wasn\'t necessary because I had paid extra deposit for them.

When the landlords asked to come with double glazing people to put new windows in the bedrooms, I agreed and a date was settled. However, my vacuum broke two days before and I had not been able to vacuum. I explained this to the landlord rather than postpone the date (for his benefit) but with two very hairy dogs naturally there were dog hairs. The Dyson repair man came that day and I was able to vacuum, but still the landlord complained to the agent the following day about dog hairs. He also spent the time the glazing people were there going into all the rooms and nosing about.

I am a 68 year old widow living alone and I found it very uncomfortable to have the landlord doing all repairs, rather than a qualified specialist, and I found his attitude bullying and intimidating. 

The Deposit Protection service used by the agent had complicated rules for reclaiming my money, useless to anyone without the internet. They allowed the landlord to put in a claim after the deadline, so that was fourteen days lost. I was not shown the evidence he eventually put in at the last minute, but was told if I wanted to see it I would have to ask for an extension. I then had to wait 28 days before they agreed a division of the deposit, despite it being evident from the evidence produced at the beginning. To find out how anything was progressing, I had to phone up.",22-06-2016 07:04 AM,£695

He would not get repairs done promptly. There was a persistent water leak from the cistern in the ensuite bathroom. He said he would investigate it but it took him more than 12 months to do so and then he tried to shrug away the problem dismissing the accrued £1400 excess water bill. We accepted a settlement of £1000 although it was wholly his fault for dithering and delaying the repair. There was also a loose kitchen tap that took him over 2 years to fix. He came around with a spanner and was not secured properly. 
Barry King is an unethical person to deal with, taking advantage of our vulnerable situation. My elderly and unwell father rented his flat at 11 Oadtrin lodge for over 5 years but his greed to cash in at a difficult time for us at the end of the tenancy reflected his inhumane and heartless character. At the end of the tenancy, he also had the audacity to enter and redecorate the flat without our permission before the handover. As a landlord myself, I will never consider to take advantage of any of my tenants.

The oven wasn\'t cleaned, the letting agents had covered up a hole in the floor with a doormat, the cupboards in the kitchen were unfinished, there was a massive hole in the wall where they had excavated to make a drain pipe for the sink, but never bothered filling up, poor quality finish in the bathroom, for starters. To boot, the landlord claimed that the property had been ‘newly renovated’ (see pictures).

The first year, the rent was £675 (which is what we bid while the property was to let at £650). 
Upon requesting a contract renewal for the second year, and that we be allowed to take our cat with us, the landlord(s) informed us there would be a £20 rent raise for that reason, up to £695. 
Upon enquiring about a contract renewal for another year, the landlord informed us the property was now being valued at £760 a month, and as such he would up the rent to £730.
All this was still fine, but in the same mail I had requested permission to paint a decorative pattern around the door and do some maintenance on the wall behind the stove (all this out of my own pocket). 
He informed me off the bat he would be happy to let me redo the wall behind the stove, but after several back and forward mails (including me complaining about not being allowed to decorate the property I intended to live in), he told me they \""weren\'t comfortable\"" letting me paint any patterns.
Taking that as a red flag, my fiance and I handed in our letter of notice.

This is nothing new, as when we asked him to fix the sink after the plug had fallen through, he replied that it was \'due to a lack of cleaning\'. When I offered to remove the old wooden deck which was starting to rot, he had no qualms whatsoever. Definitely a landlord who is more worried about the betterment of his property than the quality of life of his tenants. 

As a first time tenant, I would seriously advise against moving into this property or at least under this landlord, unless you intend to live in it doing anything to the property at all (except if it benefits the landlord, ofcourse.)",20-09-2021 05:05 AM,£730

Furthermore, the Waitrose supermarket next door also attracts a lot of people, including beggars, who tend to be quite loud until very late at night. 
Whatever good aspects the flat has they are completely undermined by the landlord. She is totally and completely unresponsive, very rude and unpolite.

We flagged this and were told to leave as we found it. 

On exit, the inventory report was not sent to us until the landlord had already made a claim with the tenancy deposit scheme for cleaning the house and garden. 

The first draft of the exit inventory supported our position. After the report was completed the estate agent asked for it to be amended to include pictures of debris in the garden from two bean bags we had left in the back alleyway to be removed by the bin men and some scratches to wooden floor in hallway which is not in a good state of repair. Fair enough, (my husband) perhaps we shouldn\'t have left the bean bags relying on the bin men to take but we should have been notified and asked to clear ourselves. 

The invoice submitted for their claim from the deposit scheme mostly covered repairing the back door which didn\'t work before we moved in and a bench which was also broken. Only £150 of £900 claimed was for clearing the garden debris - which we have admitted through the claim. 

We moved out on 14 Oct 2022 and are still waiting for the return of our deposit incorrectly claimed from us. Wish us luck that - despite the many delays on the side of the deposit scheme that rely on the inventory report and decide on our favour.

As a final note, this property has had a lot of work done to it by the landlord. The finish is not good when you live there and can look closely.",15-03-2023 01:59 AM,£1800

We rented 15 Buchan Street, Hamilton and the owner of the letting agent was actaully the owner of the property, although he has registered with the Landlord Registration using a company name, Excel Property. When we moved in the garden was in an appalling state. There were bits of cars, rotten carpets, broken glass, branches, rubble and all manner of other junk lying in it. The trees were overgrown and when a branch fell off one destroying a section of the next door neighbour\'s fence the owner of the property and owner of Concept Property, denied that he was responsible for the upkeep of the garden to him. After the letting agency failed to deal with the mess in the garden we ended up cleaning the garden and removing the rubbish ourselves. The house had problems with mold and dampness. At first I put the almost clownish incompetency of the owner and his staff as being down to laziness or inexperience but I saw the nasty side of the owner when he failed to answer emails requesting repairs and acted in a dishonest manner on several occasions. My son has Autism and PICA, to our horror we found out that the property had lead contaminated paint and soil. There was paint flaking off the old wooden frames of the single glazed windows. My son ate some of this contaminated decayed wood, and other exposed paint, leading to there being high levels of lead in his blood and it is probably that he has suffered brain damage. It was impossible to watch him the whole time as we have other children and an unpleasant email from the Letting Agency suggested that it was our fault that he had lead poisoning due to us not having taken proper care of him! When the windows were eventually replaced, the owner of the letting agency/house assured us that this would be done safely but instead Doherty arranged for this to be done as cheaply as possible by his handyman. Health and Safety guidelines were not followed and our health was put at risk, my wife was expecting at the time. On several occasions emails highlighting the need for repairs were ignored by the letting agent. We were reminded twice that the house was cheaper than other properties in the area, suggesting that we should just put up with the poor state of the house. Our rent was put up a few times in spite of the poor overall condition of this property with no central heating. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this letting agency as they were extremely incompetent and the stress of dealing with them is not worth it. This letting agency is very unprofessional and I fear that other families may have experienced similar problems with Concept Property Letting Ltd. I do not know how the owners of the agency can live with themselves after the way they treated us.",01-03-2019 07:18 AM,

I was newly married and my wife just came over to the UK so I was looking for something reasonable for the missus to move in. 

I asked for a replacement for the mattress at starters as I developed back issues as it was uneven from my side! They sent one but never collected the old one as they claimed it had bed bugs! We never suffered from anything, but, when I checked for signs of bed bugs I found traces. The agency accused me of bringing bed bugs into the property and they threatened that if I don\'t bring any company to clean up they will take it off my deposit!!! I got terrified until I got super lucky by meeting the previous tenant who came to collect his post. He told me that they struggled with bed bugs and they brought a company three times to solve the issue! So it turned out that nothing was thrown out post to treatment of infestation and hence the signs all over the bed. Anyways, even that they changed the mattress the bed was still tilted and when I checked under the mattress I found out that the bed was broken! When I told the agency they went like will you broke it and you\'ll have to replace it and I did in fear of cutting off my deposit. 

Speaking of the insulation issue. It turned out that the loft wasn\'t insulated at all! Like at all, when you go up to the loft you can see the light penetrating the roof tiles! As I said earlier they promised that they\'ll have it sorted. 

Funny thing is, they never tried to do it the right way! they were trying to get the house insulated through schemes to help people on benefits so they get it for free. I work on full time and my missus is sponsored by me which prevents her from access to such things which is something that the should\'ve thought of! The house never got insulated and we struggled with the same issue again. As my deposit was held by them it was nearly impossible for me to rent another flat while they held my deposit! 

The last thing they did was that before I left the property, I gave a month notice, they said don\'t worry if you left earlier, we will refund whatever is left from your rent for the month. It was £200! after I elected they said well, we would\'ve returned it if someone else moved in straight after! and I have it writing from them but they never agreed to give the money back! I raised to the ombudsman but the ombudsman claimed and after one year that I didn\'t submit all the right documents to raise a case against them!

- The flat is small. The bedrooms are an OK size, but the combined lounge/kitchen is small, and has sloping ceilings that make it feel more so. That said if it\'s only 2 of you living there, and you\'re in and out a fair bit, it\'s not that bad
- It gets very hot during the summer
- Furniture in the lounge was very dated
- The doorbell never worked, and it\'s hard to hear any knocking
- Pub on the corner of the road means there would occasionally be drunks there, and urinating on the street. They never hassled anyone though, and it was only the end of the road.
The positives
- Very responsive landlord. Fixed issues quickly, and was a nice guy. Returned the deposit at the end with fair deductions and in quick time. Also made some small touches that were appreciated, like giving us chocolates and a card at Christmas and being fine with us putting up pictures
- Warm in winter (yeah a counterbalance to it being hot in summer)
- Furniture in the bedrooms was of good quality
- Bedrooms had plenty of storage
- Bathroom was recently renovated to a high standard
- Very close to the tube station & shops, whilst generally being very quiet

Landlord literally bought the furniture from EBAY. Poor quality. The chairs broke off when I was sitting on them. Three of them, completely ruined and my boyfriend got injured and he was BLEEDING . All this landlord can say that he is ‘toleranting’ my boyfriend’s stay (he is my guest, and I do not need his permission/tolerance of course) and he called this ‘ANOTHER CAN OF WORMS’

Instead of any APOLOGY, the landlord decided to KICK ME OUT after said yes to my tenancy extension. 

Do not even try to work with him, even better, don’t rent it at all. There are so many furnished flat in the city centre that is CHEAPER.

There are silverfish in this property, it kept going on during my stay.

However, the Landlord lives abroad and is extremely difficult to contact. This includes when it comes to returning the deposit - we have been waiting 6 weeks now and a week into raising a dispute with the deposit protection scheme and we have literally heard nothing. The dispute process takes up to 8 weeks. 

Chancellors, the letting agent and property managers, also take a very long time to respond, if they respond at all. There were a few minor property repairs we wanted completed before we moved in and managed to put them in as conditions of tenancy in the contract. By the end of the tenancy, they still hadn\'t done them. They were just relying on us not having the energy to take them to court over minor repairs, i guess. 

I would avoid this property even though it looks ok for price. The incompetence of the landlord and managers in key areas makes it not worth it in my opinion.",08-09-2017 07:09 AM,£1000

There is quite some fluctuation, often there is a flat on the market.

The agency seems to consistently list these with photos as it was when the conversion was completed. Viewing is absolutely a must (it was not possible due to Covid when I took it), in my case, as on the attached sample page, what I got versus what was listed.

Attitude of the agency is lacking. Repairs get done adequately, that seems to be about all. Received no help with a meter mixup the property had, causing me to pay someone else\'s electricity (credit meter) in addition to mine (actual installed key meter).

Running cost Estimate by EPC rating is way off. Electric heating. Poor insulation. In February, maintaining 15°C took £350, and energy prices are even higher since then.

Not a bad place if you are fully aware of what you get. The building has character, the flats are unique, many having own doors to the outside (12 does not, opening into the corridor), plenty of parking space and open area around. With proper ventilation, moisture isn\'t an issue (at least during my tenancy, the horrible initial conditions, a room reeking of damp resolved).

If you think about it, make sure to view, don\'t expect the agency be of much help, and be aware of that in the winter it will be costly. Keeping these in mind, knowing what you get, it can be all right.",17-11-2021 05:04 AM,£545

Huge carpeted living room, two large bedrooms (one with en suite bathroom), one tiny bedroom, kitchen small but functional. Very family friendly building, with kids often playing in the communal shared garden.  Extremely close to regents park and the canal, a short walk from st johns wood high street which had various shops, cafes, and a small tesco. About ten minute walk to St John\'s Wood tube station. Landlady was very friendly.

MOLD - property had a serious ventilation problem. Lots of condensation, which often led to black mold growth. Over the winter, when windows were more often closed, this was unmanageable. We had significant damage to our clothes due to mold growth in wardrobes. The landlady did her best to help us out, buying us mold killer and cat litter to act as a dessicant, but it was a losing battle. 

Heating - Boiler was pretty unreliable. Once leaked and caused damage to the flat below. However, property usually stayed warm even when was heating off.

Safety - Area usually felt very safe during the day. However, the area is a stark mix of very affluent houses and council estates and was very quiet late at night so walking alone late didn\'t feel comfortable. I had two different bikes stolen from parking on the street outside and had to switch to santander cycles as a result.

Property management - we had minimal contact with the letting agents (winkworths), usually interacting with the landlady or with the building management. Building management were overbearing and threatened to fine us when we left our moving boxes on the balcony while waiting for bin collection. They also did not allow bicycles in the building and refused to even consider a request to change the rules since we were only tenants. At the end of the tenancy, the landlady/letting agents tried to charge us to repaint the walls and buy new beds, but reconsidered when we pointed out most of the damage was caused either by the mold problem or by her own builders who were refurnishing one of the bathrooms.",09-05-2021 06:40 AM,£2273

I have just found this website now, and it is a great idea. The management of the property is atrocious. It is owned by a huge organisation based outside of the uk, and managed by the estate agents Berkeley Shaw (who were amicable). The estate agent were very much pre-occupied with regurgitating the owner\'s \""rights\"" - and trying to avoid any issues I brought their way. On further questioning I found out that this is actually because they have no way of contacting the owners, and their go to person is the accountant who doesn\'t really seem to have a say in anything. Thus, as you can imagine, getting anything sorted was a nightmare. I had to live in this property in extreme damp conditions for 4 months before they agreed to do anything about it (as I had finally decided to move out). Any issues raised on behalf of the landlords were dealt with immediately by the estate agent, whereas any issues raised by the tenant had taken months to deal with - despite being a health hazard.",30-09-2017 02:49 PM,£450

Things to consider before moving into this property:
- The house has an inherent issue of moulds and leakage. So if the landlord complaints it is due to tenants carlessness, then be careful.
- The house has condensation issues.
- The kitchen worktop cannot handle hot vessels. so dont keep anything on it, or else the landlord will demand its replacement(mentioned in our contract). It also has lots of scratches from previous tenants. so just watch out
- The underfloor thermostat has problems with heating up. so just make sure it gets heated up before you move in. The landlord took us more than 8 months to fix, however we still stayed cold throughout the winter.
-Take as much as snaps of the house as possible even the minutest issues as the landlord can anytime turn the blame on you.
- The washing machine always had a problem and was very noisy and never washed clothes properly. so make sure you get a new one as the old one is really old.
- The bathroom does not have a vent except an exhaust fan and hence the mould might get collected in the top after every bath. however the ceiling of the bathrooom is uneven and hence cannot be cleaned easily. Just make sure that the landlord is aware of the issue, before you move
-There is a washbasin cabinet next to the bathtub and due to condensation issue, the wood might bloat. make sure you report it to the landlord regularly, as in the end the landlord might charge you.",19-03-2018 10:32 AM,£1250

Even at the hottest I could still wash up comfortably, ie it was not hot enough to kill germs and I had to change the water 3 times for one lot of washing up. The water was also not hot enough to have a bath in the winter, not that you would want to there because it was so cold. They maintained they didn\'t know how bad the boiler was...

Because of the old single glazed windows I also had damp in all the window frames and one year had an infestation of ladybugs. Random I know but apparently they hatch in mouldy windows.

My sister and her boyfriend stayed on for another 4 months. I originally moved in with my sister and her boyfriend moved in with us in 2013. We were first under the impressed that our letting agent was just that, everytime we mentioned seeing if the landlord could sort something, he told us the landlord didn\'t want to deal with the property so we took it as it was a simple buy to let. We later learnt the letting agent was in fact our registered landlord and that he had bought the property barely a few weeks before we viewed it so when we asked at the viewing about whether it had damp, he clearly stated to us it didn\'t which there was no way he would have known for sure. The flat had been recently redecorated which we also realised cover a multitude of sins and the decoration, although very lovely and neutral, was in no way practical. The bathroom initially had no tiles apart from a very small section and instead had what the letting agent/landlord said was \""expensive waterproof wallpaper\"". The hallway had plush cream carpet which is not practical and got dirty very easily and the limo in the kitchen was fitted poorly so got accidentally ripped in a few sections. After the first winter, we discovered we had a serious case of rising damp. Of course you only discover damp in the winter time, but it was so bad that prior to a trip back home for Christmas, I discovered it had caused mould inside my wardrobe (which was against an outside wall) and ruined many items of clothing, jewellery (Inc sentimental, irreplaceable items), bags and shoes. The wardrobe had to be moved to the only internal wall that wasn\'t effected by mould. I should at this point mention that the layout of the flat had been altered previously and my bedroom had previously been the kitchen and had boxed in pipes running through my room from the bathroom nextdoor. That is where the main mould was. I knew it was to do with these pipes but the landlord insisted it was poor ventilation caused by closed windows and damp coming from wet clothes hung in the kitchen and in my sister\'s room. I always had my bedroom window open during the day and so was the bathroom window (even though due to the design and it being a ground floor flat, it posed a serious security issue), and the rooms in which wet laundry were hung were not well ventilated yet they had no problems with mould or damp. We eventually fought to get the rest of the wall in the bathroom tiled after the wallpaper went black, though we had to buy the tiles and equipment and it was my step dad who came up and tiled it (we\'d had small part tiled by the landlord but not enough to do anything). We continued to complain about the mould especially as my health was starting to suffer, but after getting an expert in apparently we didn\'t have a problem. Eventually I moved out to my own place, but once I was gone the flat still was deteriorating. After my sister and her boyfriend handed in their notice, the landlord finally decided to do something about the damp. Except he decided to rip out the entire bathroom minus the toilet whilst they were still living there. Because this made the flat inhabitable, they had to stay in a nearby premier inn before they got early entry to their new property. We also had an issue with the landlord charging us admin fees for the first 2 years we were there until my sister\'s boyfriend pointed out that this was now illegal in Scotland; if he hadn\'t pointed this out we\'d had been paying extra money than we should have been. We also were plagued with spiders and centipedes due to the damp. The boiler also leaked so bad at one point that the gas engineer said we could\'ve easily have had a carbon monoxide leak. Things were just not fixed or sorted in a reasonable space of time and we were blamed for absolutely everything that went wrong with the property. We also had a small fight on our hands to get our full deposit back, which we did eventually but not until we threatened legal action.",01-03-2017 04:24 PM,£435

Aww one more thing...there is no storage whatsoever and the room is quite small for storage stuff.

My main issue was with the landlords.Yeah ...there are two of them.I dealt with one of them most of the time and all of the sudden the other contacts you with same matter...it\'s really confusing.Did I mentioned they are husband and wife?

I had bad experience with both of them.Took ages to sign the contract becouse needed some details modified.
For any matter I use to send a message like today and receive a reply within days.

During the first lockdown I explain my situation to my landlord, not working, I was struggling...but even though, I told him I\'ll pay half of my rent which I did...after few days he ask me when xan I pay the rest? I\'ve been a bit surprised becouse we just talked about it few days prior.

I only paid half rent for two months, the third month I already received an email where I\'ve been asked to start paying full rent and a quarter from before. I found it a bit unreasonable considering the situation with the covid but still I didn\'t say anything.I\'ve borrowed money and I pay as they asked.

Finally I decided to move out, I gave notice as per agreement I cleaned the room properly and I ask my lanlord to meet to give him the keys.I had to wait for few days to do that.

I\'m waitting for my deposit for few weeks already.
What I have to mention is that I was told that I have to pay raughly £50 for a wall to be paint and some holes to be repaired into the room.Fair enough I said to myself, but at the end I\'ve been charged more.
I supposed to do pest control/fumigating the room as per contract which I totally forgot , therefore I kindly asked the landlord if she agrees for me to send a company to do it or I can get a quote and she can deduct the amount from my deposit. She sent me an overpriced quote which I didn\'t agreed.

At that time I\'ve already received few quotes from few companies which were way below the price she gave me.I had to raise a dispute.They deducted for a wall painting and fumigating for a room almost half of my deposit which is a monthly pay.

I have never had this kind of issues.I have really good reviews from my previous landlord.

Still waitting for a resolution.
So, if you interested in my honest opinion? Stay away from this property.You\'ll have less headache.

Exactor in the kitchen was always broken. well finally we got a new one but after two years with the back and forth conversations. And the new exactor sucks. It not strong enough and whenever you cook food, the entire house is extremely smelly. The landlord never responds and communicate with us. The only time when he willing to talk and make a tiny bit of progress on fixing the house is the time before you need to pay rent. Other than that he never responds. 
Also, there is one time he needs to install fire alarm in our rooms he didn\'t inform us at all. Just by telling you he is going to swing by. And end he brought and handyman with him and illegally entering our room without our permissions. The worst thing is, he is leaving A MESS behind. I went home after a long working day and found out my room is covering by dust and there is A SHOES MARK on my bedsheet. My landlord let the handyman steps on my bed to do the installation works. INSANELY RIDICULOUS. We also experienced again an unexpected visit lately. So the landlord\'s daughter suddenly shows up in our place and again no one is informing there will be someone gonna enter and stay in the property. We were trying to confirm this lady identity and ended up the landlord never contact us back and we need to tolerate a stranger in the house. This is insulting to everyone. And finally, it comes to the worst experience I had in this place. I was suffering from the bed bug issue for HALF YEAR. The landlord never take the correct actions( he refused to change the bed frame and mattress at the same time, so the bed bugs keep coming back) till to a point I got bites everywhere all over my body, and finally HALF YEAR later, I got a new mattress and bed frame, problem finally resolved.

When ever there is an issue it gets the worse possible stage before anything is done, the toilet was leaking upstairs, when the landlord finally came he rocked it said it was fine and left,, the leak continued and a few month\'s later after hearing a loud rumble and crashing sound went downstairs to the kitchen below where the toilet is to find a huge hole in the ceiling, that stayed like that until i had to call in the rent assessment panel as the landlord was asking for a massive increase in rent the hole was fixed before the visit and the outside had it\'s first lick of paint for years.
When it rains hard water leaks into an attic bedroom, also a back bedroom it runs along the ceiling and drips out of the light fitting, there is mould  in a back attic room so would not allow anyone to stay in there.
Also had to get environmental health in due to the above plus the lack of electric sockets in each room the lack of double glazing and central heating means it is very cold( severe cold as EHO stated) also the electricity power board in the cellar is over 40 years old as is the wiring and requires fuse wire if the circuit was to become overloaded.
The landlord stated to the rent panel every year that the improvement work notice was done and signed off to EHO satisfaction which is totally amazing as 1, the work still hasn\'t been carried out some 7 years later and we are still waiting for the EHO to return from 2 weeks holiday that again started 7 years ago.
So now that the landlord has been given a £145 per week rent increase by the rent panel i am engaging the help from my MP and EHO in the hope that this time the work will actually be carried out.

However, there is a constant leak from roof when it rains hard. I am not sure where the water is leading to, but it passes through the underground of flat 37. When you step on flooring, water appears on the floor and your socks will get wet.
Unfortunately, there are signs of leakage all over the building. I am not sure if this is a serious problem for other flats and the whole building but for me, it is a serious issue. Black mould has started growing and if you are going to rent this flat in future, then check out the woodwork around the floor in the wardrobe and bathrooms, make sure they are brand new as at the moment, they are all wasted due to leak. There is an also clear distance in the flooring (about 1cm between clocks). If you see such distances, look closely inside them, you may notice moisture there.
If we deduce the leakage and the rumbling noise of the rooftop, it is superb. You will neven feel cold thanks to small size flats and well designed central heating systems that works with Gas. 
It is really a shame that the building management is not looking after the building as it should. it is a waste of asset.

When signing my, no pets, no children tenancy agreement in 2014, I was expecting a quiet place to live.
Very disappointed to find Landlords had a few weeks later, without consulting me, allowed my neighbour to have a dog.......which barked it\'s head off for a year. When, through lack of sleep I protested to landlords about the dog, \'I\' was asked to move out.
The noise from the nearby A30 is constant and deafening in summer and much louder in winter.
A large caravan appeared up by the stables and the traffic driving passed my house increased massively, although I was told nobody would be leaving before 7am, there was cars arriving and leaving regularly through the night all last summer, which had a huge detrimental affect of my sleeping patterns. In one period I was woken up during the night, between 11pm and 6am, by vehicles for 38 out of 40 nights.
The house itself is poorly constructed and vibrates when vehicles drive nearby, the house is on a flight path for Newquay airport and also vibrates when low flying military and civilian helicopters fly overhead, which they do daily. The house doesn\'t hold heat, which for a new build is as disappointing, as it is expensive. Having lived in a caravan before, I noticed very little difference between this house and a caravan (which can be found in accommodation ads for half my current rent).
The sewage air vent is on the roof and my kitchen has recently a strong sewage smell coming from the lower kitchen cupboards, which, for some reason have plumbing pipes in them. This latest incident is just one of many, the house was built by cowboys.
The incinerator, which can be seen from the living room, is now fully operational and is belching out toxic materials 24/7, unfortunately the area and every living thing, is now being contaminated and black smoke can be seen at night, which is worrying, as the emissions, we were told, would be white. See for yourself by using www.plumeplotter.com/cornwall. As recently as 05/04/2017 the air monitoring equipment picked up, in a number of surrounding villages levels 2,700% higher than recommended (source St Austell voice).
There is an application for planning permission on Likely Sunset.
I was never consulted and only found out by chance as the Landlords didn\'t feel I needed to know, which I again found disappointing.
I wanted a chemical free environment to live in and the Landlords use of buttercupsprays/weedkillers didn\'t go down well with me, neither did failing to maintain the field edge, which grew into my and my neighbours gardens.
At the time of writing, to my knowledge, all the information here is true.",13-04-2017 07:27 AM,£0

This property comes with the passive aggressive type who is in fact, only the &#34;son&#34; of the landlord. I never met the landlord in my time there. I found out only in the last year of our term that it is the son who collects the rent for his parents who live abroad somewhere in the Middle East. In the first 4 years we dealt with the excellent Gold Snapes who had the tricky job of dealing with the &#34;Son&#34; of the landlord. We did not realise how tricky he was until Gold Snapes closed and we were consequently forced to deal with the son directly. In the year that followed, and our last, we found his constant showing up unexpectedly, loitering when workmen are sent to fix problems, and aggressive attitude on rent hikes too much and were forced to move on. 

During our stay we experienced the frequent occurrence of general waste blockages, rodent infestations, numerous heating issues, reoccurring electrical faults, damp, moulded walls, waste pipe blockages due to poor plumbing and gas leaks more than most properties we have ever stayed in. Consequently, our health was affected with constant colds, asthma like wheezing of the chest and eczematous like skin conditions which have now all disappeared  6 months after we have moved out.

I spent my time transforming the rear &#34;jungle&#34; whilst there and only ask if you do stay to look after the acacia, pine, bay trees I planted and maintained.

Everyone I had over to my flat would comment on how grim the building is and I noticed that the majority of the people living here are students, first-time renters, poor families and people who are new to the UK. Of course. It\'s people like us who are seen as easy money.
I have warned all my friends and family to never rent from Reign and they all agreed on seeing the state of the building they never would.
Some of these issues were to do with the building I lived with rather than my flat. So I asked Reign if there is a number for the building manager. They said no such number exists and I found myself that was a lie. So I think it\'s only fair to mention those issues here too since they didn\'t direct me to anyone who could fix them.
There is no review page for the building owners but that would be B.hive property/APW who are also partially responsible for this. The state and neglect of the building they own is enough to warrant their own review.

There simply isn\'t enough time or space to go into detail of everything Reign did. But I\'ll start with the flat. Converted from an old uni building and cheaply bought up. It shows. Who puts a toilet right next to the outside wall of a corridor? The bathroom sink and shower are incredibly claustrophobic and nearing inaccessible levels and would be absolutely impossible to access if you are a bigger person.
Everytime I would wash my face/take a shower water would splash everywhere due to the miniture size. 

I am disabled, and due to their incredibly invasive background checks they are aware of that. So at first I assumed that their treatment of me was due to ableism. But it seems that it\'s a universal thing as so many others have been through the same.
Speaking to other tenants and reading the other reviews enlightened me that I was not the only one experiencing this madness. The amount of 1 star reviews should be a red flag to any prospective renter.
I have to agree with others on Sapna. Her attitude is deeply patronising, bullying and unprofessional. She appears to be receiving a lot of complaints.


Every single request was either ignored, stalled or outright denied.
Reign were especially very begrudging about supplying meter readings. I would need a reading every few months at the request of my electric company to keep my bills right and I dreaded every time I would ask for one. Of course, most of the time this was ignored but occasionally if I did receive one I was told that I was asking too often and they would drive the point of \""nobody else asks this much.\""
Firstly, I\'m sure that\'s not true and is just a singling-out tactic. I don\'t care how often others need a reading. I\'m paying my bills, I have a right to know how much I personally owe.
Secondly, A tenant has legal access to their meter. (they are locked behind a door.) And if you are prepared to charge the extortionate amount of rent of £575 for a human-sized goldfish bowl, you better be prepared to take two seconds to send a photo of my meter.
You get someone in to test the fire alarm every Friday, there is no excuse.

There were ample problems in the flat and building. Far too many to list here but some were:
Sinks that were constantly blocked no matter how many times I unblocked it, all lights in the building corridors going off so it was pitch black and nothing done about it, spider infestation in the building, smashed glass on the window upon moving in, windows permanently jammed so I could not move them to open/close, appliances that broke within 2 years including radiator/washer (electrician and repair people confirmed the shoddy workmanship.) 
Broken trip breaker in lift in building making loud noises constantly that can be heard from flat, (took over a year of correspondence to them and eventual escalation to council before it was fixed. And the noise came back a few months later. This goes without saying is VERY dangerous.), door came off washing machine that was ignored when brought to their attention, I had to message them over and over again until something was done. 
Of course, I always lived in fear of complaining too much and being evicted so I\'d often overlook many things.
To add more to the washer situation, it took them FOURTY DAYS of complaining to finally get their finger out and do something. 
Landlord came and I was baffled at how completely clueless she was. She brought no tape measure to measure the dimensions of the washer so relied on her phone charger and a marker of mine instead. She also had no idea how to dispose of an old washer in the UK. Can I remind everyone these are our landlords, the guys who are supposed to know these things.
Good thing to know my rent went on her £2000 plus Louis Vuitton bag she brought in my flat, rather than her investing in a tape measure.
Multiple types of alarms going off constantly in the building, fire alarm sounding constantly, my entire flat would SHAKE every time someone outside closed a door, I\'m guessing it\'s due to there being no insulation and the paper thin walls.
Tenants upstairs would also make banging, crashing, thumping, dragging heavy objects upstairs, slamming doors. Hammering. All through the night. The walls are so thin I could hear someone sneezing/coughing from down the hall constantly. And all noises from neighbours. There is no privacy.
Their contracted repairman came to my flat many times due to it being supplied with dreadful cheap and shoddy fixtures. He had no respect and would literally grab and throw my belongings around.
He even said when my washer was broken for over 40 days and dirty clothes piles were everywhere. \""Sorry I can\'t fix your washer next week, I\'m going to Ibiza!\"" Then why didn\'t they bother to send anyone else?


Another huge red flag would be many people moved out of our building. The turnover rate was staggering. I\'ve only been here two years but it seemed that every day almost there would be new tenants. When speaking to some of these tenants they mentioned Reign also ignored similar issues mentioned. So I was definitely not alone in this.
As well as my flat, there was constant problems with the building. Including sewage leakage that happened multiple times. It was absolutely vile. I cannot stress enough how the entire building was a place of squalor that was falling apart, without a doubt a modern day slum. Did I mention package thieves were abundant there? And how incredibly loud it was constantly? 

All my correspondence to Reign was ignored via email and the phone was never picked up until the issue reached urgent levels and I was treated like a nuisance for bringing repairs to their attention. Many of which were already issues before I moved in.
If you don\'t like tenants complaining about issues then don\'t supply shoddily made properties that are falling apart. 
When I first moved in I had the electricians sort out my oven and they certainly had some strong words for them on how cheap they are - words I can\'t publish here. 
Of course my correspondence was ignored but when it was time to renew the year long tenancy, then they decided to repeatedly hound me about that. 

There is a complete lack of empathy in regards to situations beyond your control. 
One of the worst things they did was when I repeatedly brought the mould situation to their attention and they finally decided to budge only when the whole bathroom ceiling was caked in black mould. They sent around a contractor when I had lost a loved one and was grieving. I apologised but informed them that I would have to rearrange. There was no sympathy or humanity given and they demanded to have the contractor immediately return despite the fact they knew I was grieving. This was for a mould issue that was there before I moved in and they should have cleaned up beforehand. Now because the mould grew to dangerous levels - that could have been prevented if they were competent enough to clean it before I moved in - they were scrambling to get rid of it. 
If someone had died close to you and you couldn\'t come to repair my flat I\'d totally understand. So show some basic human decency and at the very least offer your condolences.

Due to so many of these issues being ignored by them I had to take matters to the council which caused a lot of stress. The fire department also got involved due to alarms going off in the building, of course when I brought this to Reign\'s attention it was ignored.
The fire alarm would sound multiple times a day and all through the night with nobody turning it off. At that point I didn\'t know an emergency number for the building existed as Reign lied to me and said there wasn\'t one. 
So the fire brigade would arrive over and over again in multiple fire engines, wasting precious time that could be spent saving lives. 
We would usually get THREE fire engines come here, wasting resources. Non-stop over and over again to the point where most of the tenants would ignore the fire alarm because they would know it wasn\'t a real emergency. Which is a huge health and safety issue!
All because the management couldn\'t be bothered to sort out the fire alarm issue.


Not to mention, we were forced to stay outside for hours in the dark night until the alarm was turned off, this wasn\'t just a one or two time thing. It happened many, many times. Due to the neglect of addressing whoever would constantly set the alarm off.
Once I informed them I was to move out I was once again - you guessed it - ignored.
The final thing that prompted me to leave this dump was despite all the neglect they still decided to hike up the rent by a few hundred a year. THAT I DID NOT AGREE TO BUT THEY CHARGED ANYWAY. That was the final straw.

Unsurprisingly, the moving out process was also abhorrent. They tried to get viewings booked while I was still living there, they were that desperate for more money.
I did not get back my deposit either, which I suspected. Despite fighting to try and get it back they refused. I could not clean the flat fully due to needing to leave in a hurry, but was happy to pay for anything that needed doing, as long as I could receive proof of cost.
I didn\'t get any proof whatsoever and they stalled the process so I was forced to pay 2 months worth of rent for a flat I\'m not even living in anymore. And they still have the gall to ask me for even more as of writing.
I was reprimanded for not being able to clean the flat to their standard that I CANNOT do anyhow due to my disability, of which reason is NONE of their business, but once again I was still happy to pay for it done from my deposit. 
They actually asked for the money upfront until I argued with them tirelessly that it should come out of my deposit. So yes, I almost handed over yet another £575 to them. They really do clutch at straws.
They framed it in a way that I refused to pay and couldn\'t be bothered to clean, yet another hurtful lie to add to their countless others.
I was even forced to pay for things that I didn\'t do. The \""excessive marks\"" on the wall I was forced to pay for were already there all over the walls when I moved in and the condensation was due to being supplied BROKEN old windows of terrible quality that WILL NOT OPEN OR CLOSE AND ARE JAMMED.
Do you honestly expect people who have moved overseas to come back to clean their slum of a flat? You never bothered to help with anything but expect me to clean up the dump?
I can\'t stress enough how much this company are greedy thieves.
They took almost all of my deposit and I know for a fact it doesn\'t cost £575 (which is \""coincidentally\"" a month of rent.) to clean and make minor repairs to a tiny studio flat.
Again, they refused to provide any proof of cost.
Oh sorry, I guess they do need more of my money to buy a new Louis Vuitton bag...
I worked it out and have paid EXACTLY £15,500 to them and it\'s abhorrent that they have took so much of my money and have barely lifted a finger.
I have been forced to move back in with my parents due to being unable to afford their ridiculous costs. I am absolutely devastated and these leeches STILL want more of my money after I\'ve left. They also said they never got the keys back in a desperate ploy for more money, luckily I was having none of the nonsense and kept the receipt for a royal mail signed delivery. Always keep your documentation! I will not be handing any more fees, because they are happy to lie over and over again to suck you dry of as much money as possible.
If this isn\'t bad enough, my flat is currently listed online for £750. 
 I feel sorry for whoever takes that flat now! You\'re paying £200 more than it originally was!
Before there was an end to this madness, I mostly coped alone but it got so bad I had to ask for help from my mum and an external organisation because I was in tears multiple times with it all. According to my mum, Sapna implied I broke the stuff MYSELF in my flat rather than it breaking naturally due to it being CHEAP AND BAD QUALITY.
I was and still am afraid of them but I won\'t let them silence us any longer.
If it wasn\'t for me seeking help from a professional to negotiate with them they would have still been charging me more rent even though I don\'t live there anymore. I\'m baffled by how it\'s legal to force tenants to pay for a place they DO NOT LIVE AT until they find a new one.

Due to my personal circumstances, I literally could not leave. I had no money for any better. I was trapped in this nightmare for two years and scared to post this review until now as the fear of eviction was very real and being thrown out on to the streets should I speak up.
It was an extremely traumatic experience and has seriously affected my mental and physical health. 

I only hope that karma does what\'s due and Reign/Sapna/Pinky/B-Hive/Bowen Zhang/APW and everyone else get investigated, because someone needs to speak up about this, and this goes for all those who have had dealings with these crooks, past and present.
They need to be formally investigated, because the maltreatment and advantage taken of tenants needs to end.
I wasn\'t sure to share this, but this experience with living in such horrible conditions was so horrific it did cause suicidal ideation in me. I never felt safe. It was a horribly unsecure, polluted, dirty, unsafe area and I recieved sexual harassment from another tenant which I had to contact the police for. 

Decent housing is a human right. People are being forced to live in these conditions due to any decent living being completely unaffordable these days. I saw many young children and babies living in these flats and it was deeply upsetting to see.
Nobody deserves to live their lives out in misery or disrepair and I wasted two years of mine at the hands of Reign.
There\'s nothing more to say other than this agency is a perfect example of a modern day slumlord cutting corners and taking advantage of the cost of living crisis driven by greed and profit. Where you are dehumanised are treated like a cashcow.
Avoid at all costs if you value your health and sanity.

Small cupboard space allocated for dry foods, not very ideal for long term letting as you feel more like a guest rather than someone renting a room. 

Wardrobe handle was missing when moved in and not replaced. However, when second handle came loose (cheap material) a deduction was made from the deposit to fix this despite the other handle not being fixed when I moved in. Landlords used deposit money to purchase two handles which would no doubt fix both missing handles even though only one handle was damaged during tenancy. This would come under usual wear and tear and most circumstances would not have led to a deposit reduction, especially considering there was already a handle missing.

1. Predisposition to mould, but the landlord provides a dehumidifier and if proper airing is ensured and the dehumidifier is used regularly (which makes dryingclotges super quick), the situation can be managed. However it does add to the electricity bill.
2. One very difficult neighbour who will be hard to manage and behaves as if he owns the whole building. I managed to keep an acceptable relationship with him, but to my understanding I was the only one and others even sold their flats because of him. He doesn\'t actually do anything other than being annoying in his attitude and always trying to set people against each other and make you feel bad. So it can be managed if you don\'t take his comments to heart, which is what I did. But he will observe everyone like a hawk and take it upon himself to carry what he believes to be justice and chase any minor breach of any rule to extremes.

There were giant cracks all over the walls, places where the magnolia paint had been touched up in white, scuffs on the floors and mouldy windowsills. The kitchen was the worst - one cupboard door had already broken and had been fixed by attaching a block of wood to the inside of the cupboard and a hook to the inside of the door - you literally had to close the cupboard by hanging the door onto the block. Another cupboard hinge snapped during our tenancy and the landlord tried to make us pay £200; despite the repair man saying the unit was so old that replacement parts were no longer available (and despite only the hinge being broken) he insisted that it was in perfect condition and we had broken it through \""negligence\"".

He gave us barely any induction at all, leaving us to figure out how everything worked on our own. This included eventually realising after a week of trying to set the timer that the \""central heating\"" he had advertised (and still advertises!) was non-existent and what we had was storage heaters. Half of which never worked and were never fixed because when we reported them as broken, the landlord just replied \""no they are not\"". When our washing machine broke, he made us wait over a week then installed the new one himself. The first time we used it, the pipe gushed water like a tap and when the plumber came to fix it he said \""whoever put this in had no idea what they were doing\"". 

Throughout our tenancy the landlord was rude, condescending and unhelpful.

When we moved out he attempted to deduct money from our deposit for all kinds of things, from additional cleaning after we had it done professionally, to removing items we had \""left behind\"" but that had in fact been there when we moved in, to an \""admin fee\"" for him to personally walk around the flat after we had left it.

The agent in charge of managing the property was rude, unprofessional, and unhelpful. She arrived late to almost every appointment with little or no prior notice, even though we were constantly under threat of being fined if we were late. She did not seem to want to help us solve issues. 

From the beginning, we had a boiler that leaked carbon monoxide. There was a detector that did not work so it took days and flatmates becoming unwell for us to realise the issue. It was fixed but not well and became an issue again. Eventually it was fixed but a terrible start to the tenancy.  

Furthermore, the bathroom had been renovated before we moved in but it was done very poorly. For example, there was some sort of foil around wooden handles on a cabinet to make them look like they were made of stainless steel. However, as the bathroom barely had any ventilation, the foil peeled off quickly and we will be fined for damage, even though it is a design issue in the renovation. Also, there was some sort of screen put over the walls to make the bathroom look nicer and more modern. This covered the original walls and consequently, covered a window that could have been used for ventilation. This would have been helpful in preventing a buildup of steam when showering because throughout the lease, we just had to have the fan (and thus the light, increasing our electricity bill significantly) on in the bathroom at all times. Additionally, we rarely had hot water in the shower and when we tried to get it fixed we were simply told there was a water pressure issue and that we should run the cold tap in the sink to get hot water in the shower, which resulted in lukewarm water in the shower. 

As previously stated, there was a renovation carried out before we moved into the flat. This resulted in the flat being converted from a 3 bedroom to a 4 bedroom. Thus, the kitchen was directly in the middle of the flat with no windows. The renovation also resulted in the boiler being in a cupboard in a bedroom. This made the carbon monoxide leak even worse. Since this bedroom was part of the kitchen before the renovation, it had a small window with very little natural light, making the room  dark and gloomy to live in. The renovation also resulted in the flat being carpeted. Before the renovation, the flat had hardwood floors, and we requested to keep those. However, even though we had been given the option, we were told it was not possible and that it was going to be carpeted. This made the flat very difficult to keep clean as the carpet collected lots of dust. It would have been easier to clean if we had been provided with a proper hoover, but we were not and hoovering was a difficult task.

At the time of the checkout we had ridiculous fines against us for things like not hoovering (which we did, the hoover the letting agency provided us was just useless) and normal wear and tear of the paint in the kitchen. Again, it was not well ventilated so any steam from cooking damaged/stained the poor paint job. This was not due to negligence or lack of care, but once again, poor design in the renovation. 

Overall, I do not recommend the property or the letting agency (Prestige Properties).",29-07-2018 11:24 AM,£495

A failure in the roof causing rain to get funnelled into the cavity wall and the completely broken gutters took almost an entire year to get any response to despite constant chasing. Meanwhile we were forced to endure a massive build up of damp causing mould up the walls, slug infestations, peeling walls, foul odours and extremely dangerous electrics (rain would result in the fuses tripping). The heating system is shockingly inefficient and the timer does not work meaning during winter when the hot water tank goes cold/tepid (legionella risk) you can\'t have hot water when you get home from work and typically end up boiling a kettle to do the washing up. The immersion heater has a fault and will trip out the electrics almost the moment it is switched on. Our complaints that the cooker hob was dangerous as you could not sustain a reliable flame on all hobs was ignored entirely and never resolved. The equipment provided to maintain the garden was entirely unsafe. The back gate cannot be closed meaning the local kids use the garden as a shortcut between Wilbraham Road and Sopwith Road. Neighbour has been demanding the property fences are replaced for years but they continue to rot. Back door canopy is badly rotting and shedding planks (mind they don\'t fall on you). Despite constant chasing it took us 9 months to get our copy of the lease from the agents and we are still waiting to see the gas safety certificate for this year. Agent and landlord typically did not respond at all when concerns were raised and when they did it was only to send us a letter that our requested repairs would not be fixed. The neighbour has also reported a rat infestation, but to be fair we never saw any (perhaps the legions of slugs in the kitchen and living room scared them away).",22-03-2018 10:14 AM,£800

There is also an area of wall that is damaged to one of the walls in the living room. The cost to re-paint both the hallway and front room is £160.

3) The mattress requires replacing. The landlord purchased the furniture from Ikea so a new mattress has to be purchased from Ikea so that the sizes match, Ikea do not have standard sizes. The cost of this £134.

I can assure you that despite a shower curtain being mouldy (mould is extremely hard to avoid in new builds and has been an issue in every one I\'ve lived in), every issue was general wear and tear which is accepted within a tenancy. 

Avoid this flat as your deposit will go towards the owners making improvements to the flat which they should be paying for themselves. The letting agency were very unhelpful and did nothing to help us fight this.",28-07-2016 06:40 AM,£875

The area is fairly secure, we didn\'t have any issues with anyone although you may see some dodgy people in the area from time to time. We rented the flat for almost 2 years and I have to say, it was not the most grateful experience, the estate agent \""LifeResidential\"" is terrible!

When we started our tenancy we complaining about the cleanliness of the flat, which was supposed to be professionally cleaned before our arrival, but it was very dusty. We also pointed out a couple of things that were broken or not in a good state and they were not included in the inventory, but the estate agency just decided to ignore it.

After a couple of nights, we realised the mattress was horrendous, it was very old and you could feel the springs in your back all the time. After several weeks of back and forths with the agency, they told us that the landlord was not keen to replace it and if we wanted a better one we could have one. However, they were not removing the old one and the flat is not exactly the most spacious one to store an extra mattress in there. So, after a month or so with continued discussion, the landlord accepted to buy one which was worth £100... Of course, this was the same quality as the old one! That\'s when we realised there was no point to continue arguing about it because the landlord wouldn\'t do anything else for us.

Later in our tenancy, the washing machine broke and it took them about a month to get it replaced, of course, no compensation was given to us for going to the laundry during that time...
The same happened to the dishwasher, it took several weeks to get it replaced. Luckily, we didn\'t use it that often...

At the end of our tenancy, we knew that the landlord was a penny-pincher and he would try to keep our deposit, so we recorded in a video every single area of the flat so we had evidence of the state of it in case of any complaints. The landlord wanted to charge us around £300 for things that were not caused by us, and even more, these were things that we pointed out to LifeResidential when we started our tenancy. 
Since LifeResidential never supports us during this process, we opened a dispute with MyDeposits, submitted all our evidence, and let them decide what was fair. In the end, the resolution was in our favor and we got most of our deposit back.

Even when this is a lovely flat, I would recommend staying away from this landlord and if you have an option, don\'t choose LifeResidential as your estate agency, it\'s not worth the hassle!!",03-08-2021 07:27 AM,£1696

One night the mice were louder than usual, so I looked towards the wall and I saw one mouse run across the room into a hole behind the wardrobe. I called the landlord and I said I\'m moving out.

We emailed CONSTANTLY and it took 6 MONTHS for the landlord to secure our property, and he only bothered doing his job because we got environmental health involved who eventually threatened him with legal action. He uses the estate agents to manage his property so you cannot even contact him directly and estate agents are somehow not allowed to arrange any repairs to make your house safe without the landlords consent so all they can do is email him and wait for a reply. I was almost signed off work for the amount of stress this caused as this is not a safe area - check Nextdoor - and my bike was stolen with the locks cut off it within 24 hours of it being outside.

Very poor decorations, dirty old carpets (We paid nearly £200 to have them cleaned they were that bad), house was dirty despite promises it would be cleaned before we moved in. We were refused permission to repair holes in walls ourselves and told by the agents to \'put up with it\'. Decorations very dated and poor quality. Nothing worked properly.

Bathroom very poor and problem with mould which they just paint over. Neighbours drive is across window at front of house. Very intrusive, they have a large garage they use as a utility room so are always walking past the large bay window. Neighbours also very friendly with landlady.

There was a water leak from a defective drainpipe that we reported which likely contributed to the damp , but there are possibly issues with the building as well ( type of building, old windows) that make it prone to damp.  The landlady was quite responsive and did allow us to end the tenancy early.  However we had asked about damp before moving in and this was minimised and put down to previous tenants being anxious.  This was slightly how landlady responded to me.
The water leak is likely to take at least a summer to fully dry out so it’s worth being cautious about letting this property unless there’s reassurance that dehumidification of the area of the leak has happened, and that all mould has been removed before moving in.",24-11-2023 11:12 AM,£2300

There is a significant damp issue in the kitchen area. The attempted remedy was to paint inside the cupboards with damp resistant paint. This action failed. The lower cupboards in half the kitchen are usable unless you are prepared to remove items regularly to wash the mould off.
The kitchen and bathrooms are very tired although functioning. The toilet has a poorly designed u bend that continually blocks. Despite this being a design issue the agent will not repair it without charging the Tennant.

We noticed there had been an issue in the lounge with mould as the wallpaper was very badly stained but we assumed that cause of damp had been fixed.  Also the wallpaper in the kitchen was black in places  but stains looked old so again assumed problem had been dealt with but property had not been redecorated.  
We took the property because of its size and were very limited with choice at the time.  The night we moved in, we had an issue with the heating and there was a power cut so we ended up sleeping on the floor, didnt realise until many months later into the tenancy that the lounge floor was concrete and there was massive cracks in it which had caused damp issues in lounge.  Our energy bill went up because it was a cold house (the patio doors, window frames and also back door were very dated, aluminium and not fit for purpose).  This was another cause of the excessive damp and condensation problem we experienced.  We met with the landlord and he seemed nice enough but our opinion of him changed over the course of the tenancy.  He lived around the corner so would quite often turn up unannounced and had no concept of  \""Quiet Enjoyment\"". On one occasion one of the glass lamp covers in the front room fell off, it was that old.  Luckily it did not happen when anyone was around.  Unfortunately this made the light pendant dangerous because part of the electrics of the light was now exposed and when it was switched on it had live electricity flowing through it. We asked that something be done about it.  The landlord was adamant, he wanted the light to stay as it was, because the light was old it could not be replaced but the landlord was fond of it, he had previously lived in the house and was obviously attached to it and did not want his house changing.  Eventually common sense prevailed and a new pendant was fitted but we felt it should have been dealt with immediately because of the safety issue.    Winter of 2015 was really bad.  Freezing cold house when heating switched off, damp everywhere.  It became obvious house had been rented out to us with nothing been done about the damp.  We also noticed there was structural damage to the brickwork outside of the house which would have contributed to the damp.  We ended up moving out because situation was intolerable,  I remember on one occasion I was cooking a pan of pasta and didnt notice the large slug that was clinging to the side of the pan.  We had a lot of slugs because of damp.  When we moved out, landlord tried to take all of our deposit and the letting agents Quick and Clarke did not really help.  Landlord accused us of ruining work surfaces (which was obviously not true) We needed to get our deposit back so we agreed to let him have £120 to pay for new work surfaces.  Have noticed property is now up for rent.  Work surfaces are still the same so he just pocketed £120 of our money  Have noticed lounge has been painted over, one of the bedrooms has been re-wallpapered but I would urge anyone looking to rent this property to check for signs that the damp has been dealt with and if unsure ASK, the house is one of the worst we have ever rented.  Landlord also said a funny thing, said we were nice tenants and he didnt really want to take our deposit, so why did he take a big chunk of it.",01-08-2019 06:46 AM,

She took about £300 from our deposit money to do a \""top up\"" clean.  She would not negotiate with us, and became ruder and ruder.  Although it may sound petty, her husband once said (in a light, joking manner) that his wife \""has fired every single cleaning company we\'ve ever had,\"" and that, to me, was a warning sign that I didn\'t take seriously enough.  So, in summary: the property was a two out five considering the dingy environment and terrible back neighbours--and although Matt was nice, his wife made the experience of living there miserable.  We felt that we always had eyes watching us, and that nothing was good enough in terms of cleanliness and normal wear and tear.  Let alone her condescending rudeness.",10-04-2017 07:52 AM,£1400

I have not included pictures as this would also reveal my identity, there are a few of us “red flag tenants” who report a lot because there is a LOT to report.. please listen.. 

Dixon’s is the estate agent for Legends Court in Wolverhampton, this place overall is tragic. Don’t be enticed by the cheaper rent, free water/I hated parking/WiFi  (which disconnects as often as connects) or free laundry (1 washer 1 dryer for 35 flats, DIY laundry room featuring black mould and condensation)

Ask for an in person tour first before you sign anything, the building was converted from a nightclub and apparently has a flat roof which means problems are only going to get worse.

The walls are thin, the window condensation, mould and fungus flies is a disgrace.

From ground floor to top floor, multiple tenants have experienced leaks. The summer wasn’t so bad but winter was terrible, the caretaker isn’t trained to do professional fixes but this is the person used to do work we’re told “contractors” are doing.

There is no onsite security beyond 8am-2pm on weekdays, if the fire alarm goes off there is no fire marshall and everyone has to wait outside in the freezing cold unless you have a car and coordinate with the fire services while waiting for the landlord or caretaker to answer their phones or arrive

You cannot change electric provider although there is lawful entitlement to, if you’re going to brave it, buy your own lamps and invest in an oil heater, the bulbs used as standard could be their own heat source, and on average here a tenant spends £30 on electric per month, about £7.50 a week - it takes about £2 for the heater to even heat up let alone reach the entire studio

Check that inventory form, I didn’t and I wish I’d met a neighbour who did, so many issues were left out as this was conducted before I even arrived to sign for the keys, I just hope my deposit won’t suffer too badly

If you’re not familiar with the area, it’s right near the university and the football stadium as well as the city centre and easy transport links for the bus or drivers - this means the traffic can be horrendous and so can the noise disruption

Most of the flats are south facing so the light is decent when it’s sunny, and the flats get very hot over the summer

The caretaker, landlord and Dixon’s Wolverhampton staff are nice people by their own merits, but in their roles they unfortunately do an utter disservice in the way they handle the shocking amount of avoidable maintenance problems that keep happening

Most of the tenants are students or post grads who like myself were enticed by a lot of the included things, but, in hindsight I see that these “bonuses” are there because if they weren’t this building would be vacant all year around.

Every time I see a new person on a tour part of me wants to tell them to run while they can, this is the closest I can do until this contract is up

If you’re joining legends court - good luck to you, and you can find solidarity in most of the tenants here, the general consensus is that we’re all stuck so no one is trying to make that any worse, ask an experienced tenant for a laundry machine 101, and lastly, you will feel better if you don’t look up at the sky lights or walls around the building year round, the orange and black mould is a mood downer...",25-03-2021 08:59 AM,£450

All paintings and renovations were completed by us. We are really take a good care of this property. Cleaned the floor carpet every 6 months with a rented carpet cleaning machine, kept the courtyard in an organised condition, painted all the rooms, the bathroom and the kitchen to make ourselves more comfortable. However every time something had to be changed in the property like washing machine or fridge the landlord raised the rental price. 
Since the end of February our combi boiler has stopped working and the landlord only gave us promises to fix it. Claims it is our fault that is not working and should be our cost to change it,too. Clearly this boiler has not been serviced and checked in the past 5 years at least. This is the 3rd week we are left without heating although we do have some warm water occasionally. I had to go to the swimming pool for a week to have at least a proper hot shower once at the end of day.
There is promise that the boiler will be changed this week however we all hope this is really going to happen. 3 different repair guys were sent here but they were not willing to touch it just advised it has to be changed to a new one immediately. If it won`t happen and the cost will forced upon us I believe this is the time to take legal action.
The landlord also said if we do not like the state of the house we can move out. We all have these conversations in writing. 
Although none of us wants to move and the house is always clean and tidy we would love to stay here as long as we can but without heating and warm water I believe this won`t really happen. 
We always paid the rent on time and had not ask a single penny for the painting and entire cleaning but I believe the situation we are left in, is really one-sided.
Besides there is some violent crime once/twice a year in the street. Nothing serious has happened to us so far and thank God the police comes very quick in the event of emergency. The neighbourhood is kind and quiet. Although I would sleep better if we would have CCTV`s installed around the corner. 
The airplanes are coming every 2 minutes to land on City Airport just above the house howevere I must say it does not make extra unbearalbe noise. 
There is a free parking space availabe in the whole area. 
There is also a rubbish-shoot nearby that spreads foul smell a few times in a year which is a bit unpleasant but so far we did not have to report any additional inconvenient situation.

-	Close to a train station
-	Good quality building
-	Warm flat – heating is rarely required
Bad things:
-	Landlord is extremely difficult to communicate with. Any fixes take a lot of time and you are constantly blamed for everything. Before they replace something, they try to fix it in the cheapest way. For example, they fixed an electric boiler with a duct-tape… It was so bad that it started melting at night. I woke up in the middle of night so terrified because the room was full of smoke. At the end, they were trying to put blame on me rather than apologize for that.
-	Still fighting for my deposit – the process is deliberately delayed, for example by ignoring my emails
-	Intimidating check out process, ended up paying much than a fair price
-	A lot of noise from downstairs pub – the area is getting very crowded
-	Electric shower is much more expensive than gas-heated water
-	During checkout, I was told a lot of lies, accusations etc Extremely unpleasant situation. 

Overall:
If you can afford something else, stay away as dealing with the landlord is very intimidating and you will lose more money at the end.

I used to ignore her as I was uncomfortable about this but she was very persistent.
After five years I began to notice that my gas boiler was never checked every year and that the gaps between one boiler service and the next were widening. The landlord started either ignoring things I requested; for example, there was an old - fashioned pantry with a tiny window that was jammed open. I asked that this please be fixed so that I could shut it but it was never done, so the flat was colder than it should have been, resulting in higher bills. I actually started my tenancy in June 2007 and by 2012 mould began appearing on the outside walls of one of the bedrooms and in the hallway, again on the outside wall, despite never drying clothes in rooms with closed windows. When I mentioned this to the landlord all he said was \""this flat has always been damp\"". No measures were taken to fix it so I ended up cleaning the mould off regularly myself. Once I rang him up at home and got his wife instead who was rude and antagonistic for no reason. He himself started complaining about the cost of everything, how poor he was and couldn\'t afford things, etc but I noticed that he bought himself a brand new car, had a boat, had a new roof on his own house and the cottage next door to his which he also owned and managed to afford a three-week cruise last year.
There were originally four Scotch pines at the end of the garden which hung over the washing line and were quite large. I asked if they could be trimmed back but he refused saying that they were a protected species (they aren\'t). When I told him this he said he wasn\'t going to cut them back because his wife liked trees! Yet when the new neighbours moved into a house which backed onto the rear garden on my flat and therefore realised that these trees were a problem, asked to cut the branches down, the landlord\'s wife gave permisdion so the argument didn\'t stand up.
The last straw was in October 2013 when I collapsed in my hallway. In order to get the paramedics to gain access to the flat it needed to be unlocked which I was unable to do so I ended up in a roundabout way getting in touch with the landlord\'s wife. She came around, along with her friend downstairs, who always claimed that she couldn\'t climb stairs yet managed it on that occasion, and they not only allowed the paramedics in but went through some paperwork I was sorting out without my permission (I discovered it had been disturbed when I was discharged from hospital a week later). I also discovered that the landlord\'s wife had given a spare key to my flat to the downstairs neighbour which I apparently agreed to when I was very ill when I collapsed so was in no state to agree to anything. I discovered after being at home for two weeks that certain items were missing from my flat including am old passport, a Christmas present and various small items that I would have not missed immediately. After a months or so I had to have a major operation and again found more items missing after I had returned home. I ended up notifying the police who, after hearing the evidence, said that they were satisfied that it was someone with a spare key but didn\'t have any proof. Prior to that incident I had also had trouble with my bank and for six months my rent wasn\'t being paid on time. I notified the landlord but when it kept happening he became unpleasant and although the rent was always paid I would receive several texts. Once, he even drove to my flat to tell me that my rent was late, instead of texting or ringing. He always got his full rent, however, and had other properties so was never out of pocket. Even after the banking issues were solved he started complaining about the lack of money, being poor/old/ill and I just put it down to his manner but it never stopped him from going on holidays or spending money on his own home. All in all, from the day I moved into that flat until October 2015, I paid a total of £60,200.00 in rent out of which he could have afforded to reduce the trees, solved the damp problems, fix the pantry window and in fact done away with the pantry completely as it was pretty hopeless and done all sorts of other jobs like decorate the flat (it wasn\'t touched the entire time I was there) yet spent it on himself, his home and boat and family. I did get my deposit back but suspect that this was mainly due to the police being involved in 2014 (one police officer said he would speak to the landlord to ask him if the lock could be changed; this he did but when the landlord had to pay £30 for this he complained to me about the cost despite having several years\' worth of rent from me which of course easily  covered the cost of the lock. The police officer concerned also told me that I should be careful as he had spoken to the landlord and found him told be \""extremely unpleasant\"".
I would warn anyone about this man and wife team, as well as the downstairs neighbour who still lives there despite claiming that she hates it, and to ensure that have some form of security cameras installed in the flat to record anything untoward and to be on their guard. Never tell the neighbour anything you do or when you\'re going away, and never discuss the landlord and his wife with her as she will twist your words and it\'ll get back to the landlord. Better still, think twice before taking this flat on, nice though it is.",05-05-2016 04:53 AM,£700

It\'s expensive but would have been worth the money if not for the following.

At the time we rented the landlord was managing the property and that was not a good situation at all. We had a blocked kitchen sink, which would fill up with waste water whenever we used the washing machine or dishwasher. We had to empty this throughout the washing cycle with buckets which we emptied in the upstairs toilet. We emailed the landlord about this regularly and she failed to send someone out to fix it for 6 months. 6 months of not being able to do laundry or dishes without having to run back and forth with a bucket to empty the sink. When she eventually did send someone to fix it, it was shortly before the end of our lease.

On two occasions that we know of she let people into the flat without even notifying us first, let alone asking for our consent which is the legal requirement. We only knew because one of us happened to be working from home at the time and had strangers letting themselves into the flat. Although we cannot know for certain that there were more times we are sure of it due to a random email we got from the landlord about the state of the property (everything was covered in plastic sheets from the decorators that the landlord herself had sent out due to cosmetic damage from a water leak in the above property).

She tried to take more than £1900 out of the deposit for repairs. When asked why/for an itemised bill for the work she sent a Word document with descriptions of the work (almost all improvements to the property, not repairs) which was not itemised. For months we went back and forth (or \""back\"" only really as she rarely responded to emails) and eventually went to the dispute service associated with our deposit protection scheme. Upon seeing our evidence (photos, videos, emails, the report from the inventory company which the landlord had chosen) and her evidence (the aforementioned Word document and not much else) the dispute service\'s arbiter granted her £141. The arbiter agreed that the landlord was charging us to improve/renovate her property, not repair it. 

There are many other incidents like the above that we can describe, I will make them bullet points to not make this too much longer:
-a condition of us signing the tenancy agreement was her removing some furniture items within 2 months of us moving in - she never did during our almost 2 years of living there.
- friendly emails rarely got a response. Firmer emails resulted in very rude/hostile (in our opinion) responses.
-she did not respond to emails (from us or the letting agents) asking for a reference. This made it very, very difficult for us to secure our next rental property.

The Room is spacious with 1 chest of drawers and two wardrobes, one with drawers. There are a clean communal 3 pieces bathroom and nice communal garden. The key here is that you are living with the landlady, she is a sweet and kind person when she is sober. I will impartially break down the good, the not-so-good and the bad about this place.

The Good
The 418 and 467 bus stop are 5 minutes walking.
The 71and N65 bus stop is 20 minutes walking.
There are small shops close by (Tesco Express, Nissa Local, Horton Express).
There is a bar 15 minutes from the house.
The neighbourhood is quiet and once people get to know you, they are friendly.
The room is quite big and comes furnished.
The landlady offers to cook one meal for you if you agree to do the groceries with her.
There is a cat in the house.
You can smoke in the kitchen.
You can sit in the lounge and watch TV.
There is off-street parking.
Bills are included.

The Not-so-good
She smokes in the kitchen.
She only does her groceries on Sainsbury\'s online.
There is a cat in the house.
Her cooking is not-so-good, but she is cooking for you so why the complaint?
The house can get cold even with the heating on.
She can be noisy and try to comment on your affairs.
The curtains let all the light pass through so you will need something to cover your eyes if you want to sleep pas 6 am.
You can only use the tumble dryer for 40mins max.

The bad
Is quite annoying to be around her when she is not sober.
She smokes a lot and the smoke can enter the room.
Try not to use much water when washing the dishes or prepare to have a long
conversation with her.
Internet is unstable and keeps dropping now and then, and according to her, that is normal around here.
If something is broken in the house it might take a long while to get fixed.
When she is mad at you, she will insult you and then pretend she is talking to herself or the cat.

Living here is her way or the highway so if you can cope with all that then this is the place for you, else keep looking.",02-07-2020 09:32 AM,£500

- Generally very cold, not helped by the old boiler
- Damp and musty
- A mouse problem every winter

The landlord would also increase the rent significantly each time the contract was up for renewal, charged a high admin fee for references, and made deposit deductions for fairly flimsy reasons. They were also very slow at making repairs, though they would get done in the end.

On the plus points, the flat had a nice little outside space, was in a safe, nice area and was an OK size. Whilst it took a bit of convincing to get most of the furniture replaced, it was in reasonable condition, if pretty old.

Any repairs brought up during heir inspections were never dealt with, even when I presented them with an in-depth list. Lack of fence repairs meant it was dangerous to enter the back garden due rusty nails and bits of broken fence, this was reported but ignored then they claimed garden clearing fees from the deposit even though it was a death trap due to their negligence. 

Many times when any of the provided white goods broke down they tried to claim they weren\'t provided with the property, until I mentioned the numerous photos and listings on the inventory. One incident they ignored a request to service the washing machine and it had a massive failure taking out the house electrics and causing £300 damage to electrical equipment. They refused to pay for damage and costs due to their negligence and threatened us with eviction.

They tried to put the rent up by a silly amount so we put in for a rent review and the rent was reduced rather than increased. However Mr. Home served me notice two days after I put the papers in for the review.

Before singing anything I asked about pets and they said that was fine, they even took the pet clause out of the tenancy agreement, yet every time something came up they said I wasn\'t supposed to have pets, and kept making it an issue.

It was clear from the first few months of the tenancy that they didn\'t want me there. Yet I paid rent on time and early most months, reported all damage and repairs and did everything they asked within reason. They wanted rid of me so bad that they had no plan to re-rent the property and now nearly a year and a half later the property is still empty.

When it came to getting the deposit back they refused to send me evidence of the so-called damage I did. I asked on several occasions and went to the deposit scheme they dragged their feet submitting everything at the last hour. They told me I can get the evidence from the deposit scheme, yet the scheme refused to send it to me and the agency also refused. I had no leg to stand on and was unable to reasonably defend myself. I got nearly half the deposit back but was still charged for things I knew weren\'t my fault and I had provided evidence to prove that. And after the deposit schemes decision I was not allowed to appeal or take it further so justice could be done.

There was a shared garden between the properties that no one was allowed. It was overgrown and filled with rotten furniture, both a fire hazard and vermin hazard. Every reasonable request was met with arguments from her. She once accused us of asking her father to do too much work: we never spoke to her father, we asked her to fulfil her duties of repair as landlord and she\'d sent her father. She also seems to be breaking council bylaws by renting the property, but I\'m not certain of this. There was a half-finished en-suite-kitchen attached to our loft converted 2nd floor room, that didn\'t seem to be built for any practical purpose.

The landlord prefers to accuse tenants of ‘buying dirty oil’ than to repair it. The pressure gauge is broken and the button markings have rubbed off a long time ago. The landlord refuses to fit a thermostat throughout tenancy. The front stable-style door was so badly fitted and drafty that we had to cover it and not use it. We had consistent mould problems in the bathroom which we kept reporting to no avail for over a year and half - until the slow leak finally gave in to a full bursting of the pipe in the wall. This could have been dealt with when we first reported it by a quick investigation by a plumber. The worst landlord I could have ever imagined. Any time you’d report a problem with their property they would first accuse you of causing it, or argue with you some other way. This landlord put up the rent by the maximum legal amount allowed; two years in a row and sends intimidating texts trying to convince you that you have to agree with it. He then goes on to say that if he was not legally bound that he would raise it by hundreds. The landlord does not reply to emails and consistently ignores you. This landlord does the minimum legally that he has to, and yet raises the rent twice during a global pandemic.

The room was good, cannot complain. However, there were certain drawbacks that you can find below:
1. Landlady had a cat, which she keeped \'on a diet\'. The animal was always hungry and did not stop meowing even at late night. I could barely sleep sometimes because of that.
1. Live-in landlady did not behave appropriately. I tried to have a dialog with her many times, pointing out some problems around the house which needed to be fixed. As a response she screamed and was swearing in very bad way. Several times she came home very late and if she saw anything around the kitchen or the house she didn\'t like she started screaming even at midnight or later. For a person, who needs to go to work next morning, that was not very good experience. Next day I normally received SMS from her saying \'I feel bad about last night. It was an over reaction. I\'m sorry\'. And it repeated several times which made me very nervous every time when we were at home at the same time (she didn\'t work and was almost always in on weekends).
2. The house is very cold in winter, especially my bedroom. The heating is off at night. I bought a room thermometer and it showed 16 degrees sometimes.
3. Wi-fi is super slow. Actually it was not working at all, when landlady used her computer or watched TV in living room. It is impossible to watch movies or skype at home.
4. The fridge was tiny for two people living at the property.
5. Overground trains right opposite the window. They start running around 5.30 and it is difficult to sleep. Additionally, warehouses occupied by delivery companies were opposite my bedroom window. The landlady said it would not be an issue, but actually they worked even on weekends and sometimes very early hours. The independent gallery at the end of the road frequently had late night and very loud parties during the week.
6. All the buses to the center run through very congested areas - Liverpool street station or Old street roundabout. Which made my commute to work very slow and long process.
7. Some items around the house - shaky gate lock, fallen apart kitchen shelves and leaky bath needed urgent repair. But landlady did not listen to any complaints and did not want to invest in the house maintenance.",07-08-2017 01:44 AM,£900

The site incorrectly matches Flat 1 to Flat 2 as per the address above.

My honest recommendation is that you do not live here unless you work unusual hours or are deaf. The flat is directly above a bar which plays very loud music constantly. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are hellish with the bass rumbling through both the living room and bedroom untill at least midnight. The bar managers are frankly uncaring and unhelpful with regards to the issue, choosing often to continue playing the music after the bar has closed and arguing when you request that it is either turned down or off. The council is also unhelpful, not responding to noise complaints. As well as the bar below, the property also faces onto a busy A-road and the sound of traffic/trucks/sirens etc. can be heard near constantly. Finally the back of the property where the bedroom is, faces onto a small car park. This is apparently a choice spot for teenagers to meet, drink and smoke weed, the smell of which fills the bedroom, as well as a common spot for loud arguments.

The flat itself is quite nice and whilst I liked the area I cannot say the same for my girlfriend. She complained of constantly feeling scared and unsafe particularly as she had to pass the leers and jeers of the patrons of the bar below who, by the way, drink directly outside the front door often blocking it and leaving glasses and cigarette butts there.

Finally, with regards to the flat induction process. All went well untill our estate agent lied to us 72 hours before we were due to move in by telling us that we needed to take out contents insurance through their provider before they could release the keys. They did back down on this with minor push back however.

I cannot stress enough that this property is not fit to be lived in. Unless you enjoy the sound of loud bass and find the sensation of rattling floors to be a pleasurable one.",13-10-2020 04:08 PM,£1100

When we initially viewed the property there were issues to address:

- walls marked
- kitchen cupboards/drawers damaged
- bathroom tiles cracked, and skirting damaged
- landlords property remained on premises
- flat hadn\'t been professionally cleaned
- locks hadn\'t been replaced (previous tenant was evicted)

We had asked for these to be done prior to moving in. The landlord had 2 weeks to carry out these works (which we thought quite minimal).

Upon moving in, the kitchen had not been fixed, the paint job was poor, the tiles had only been filled with grout and the flat hadn\'t been cleaned. The landlord opinion of this was that, the works in question weren\'t important and could wait.

The landlords attitude overall was appalling. He didn\'t see us as people who would occupy his property, but simply as a means of profit.

A few nights after we moved in, we realised we had many mice and upon complaining to the agency, we were told it was the neighbours fault. After consistently contacting us, they finally called the council round but this was an ongoing issue as there were many gaps in the flat allowing easy access. We then realised we had bed bugs as although we were told we had been given a brand new bed, we hadnt. They had left an existing wooden frame and then given us a new mattress. No help was extended to us and we had to resolve this ourselves. The heating broke down and the emergency number they gave was never manned. We would have to call and leave messages and then follow up with emails which would not be responded to in a timely manner. We asked if we could get a cat to help with the rodent issue but this was refused. The communal hallway was cleaned once in a 2 year period (contract said this would be cleaned professionally occasionally but once is not occasional) and smelled really bad. We were told this was because the neighbours left their bin bags there but we never saw any sign of this happening.

Someone came into the property when we were not there but this was met with denial even though items had been clearly moved.

The agency was \""kind\"" enough to broadcast its purpose in a mass email during the height of the Covid-19 crisis, threatening anyone with eviction if rent was not paid on time. Rent is the \""priority\"", health comes second, the message said. No joke.

The flat on 57 Woodbine Street, which is situated in a lively neighbourhood, simply serves to extract rent for the landlord. It is in need of urgent repair, which, perhaps to little surprise, has been admitted by the estate agent\'s contractor, our own builders and other independent ones. Our trouble with the flat, the landlord and the agent started very early on. To our regret, we ignored the many warning signs (e.g. patronising estate agents, bossy landlords, ambiguous fees, (now illegal) residency checks, etc.). We hope that this review warns potential renters, but also clients of the estate agent and their predatory practices.

Our trouble started already on the second day of our tenancy. Water poured down through the ceiling and even lamps (!) onto our PC, books and other possessions (we are seeking damages). The estate agent was very slow to respond to what appeared to have been a leak in the flat above. In fact, the issue was resolved only after the mediation of our neighbour\'s agency. The agency responsible for the flat sent their contractor many days after. The poor contractor is paid badly and not given the financial means from the landlord to repair anything structurally. Throughout our tenancy, we struggled with mould, damaging our health (claims forthcoming) whilst requests and pleas to offer and install systematic solutions were continuously ignored and even ridiculed (e.g. our names misspelled continuously and, it must be said, very creatively, silly instructions to open the window in the winter etc.). Now, after having left the property, the landlord has tricked us into a deposit dispute, refusing to return it, using all the familiar trickeries. Raising awareness for such extractive practises now has become a principal issue for us, hence our recommendation not to rent this property.

In short, do yourself a big favour, avoid the property and rent from another agency and landlord. We wish someone would have warned us.",06-10-2020 01:50 PM,£470

She\'s been abusive via text, refuses to answer phone calls, asks the same questions multiple times and when you answer them she messaged again as if you didn\'t, telling you, you aren\'t being difficult with her. 
Wants to do unnecessary work whilst youre still in the property. Paint etc. She isn\'t a very nice person. Refuses to do any work and we\'ve done it all ourselves in 5 years.",17-07-2022 03:25 AM,£800
