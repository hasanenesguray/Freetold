Unfortunately the house has very thin walls and floors. We can hear any movement from upstairs at all times and the tenants downstairs complain to us about very normal things to do in the house, like talking or having TV on. They would knock on their ceiling at any time, including very early mornings, waking us up, for no reason. We don\\'t snore, we don\\'t party in the house, we don\\'t have blasting music on, we don\\'t watch loud TV and we don\\'t do anything at unreasonable times, therefore there is no explanation to the stressful time they\\'re making us go through. On top of them complaining to us, there\\'s also the fact that we can hear the upstairs tenants very loudly, we fall asleep with the sound of someone snoring in some other apartment, we can hear vibrating phones receiving messages throughout the night from other apartments. The road is fairly quiet. The only year-round noise we have to complain about is the house itself.","5":null,"6":"We rented\u200b that house because we needed a place to live the first time we came to London, we were in a hurry but otherwise we wouldn\\'t\u200b have chosen that house. The doors in bathroom and kitchen doesn\\'t open completely, no shower curtain, sockets inside the closet in the master bedroom and the house was really dirty when we started living there...\r\nWe had a lot of problems with the letting agency, Marsh&Parsons. They told us (in an email) that if we left the property before the breaking clause we only had to pay 10% of the rest of the contract, but after signing the contract they told us that we had to pay the full amount. In another situation a person entered our home without noticing, opening the door with the keys they have. After complaining they told me that the person was cleaning and he entered the house by mistake. The hob broke in December and they took a month to repair it, so we couldn\\'t cook during all Christmas.\r\nAlso, the agency was really quick to take our money, but it\\'s been 3 weeks since we finished the contract and we still don\\'t know about the refund of the deposit, we keep asking and they answer with evasives. \r\nTo improve things, the neighbours told us that a couple of years before the ceiling of the house fell, because the house is really old.

The landlord acted as the management agent on the property and in our opinion was very slow to react to issues, we had a broken boiler that took three weeks to be rectified and a severe roof leak that points to potential structural defects in the property. The maintenance company that came to review the property believed they saw signs of damp in multiple locations throughout the property. In three and half years our landlord never inspected the house to see if any upkeep was required in the property and has flagged a multitude of these issues as reasons to not release out deposit. We have had to resolve this by taking them to the TDS. Be warned, there are better properties out there than this one in the area.","11":null,"12":"Absolutely dreadful. Avoid at all costs. Landlord makes money by bringing in people who hate the place, quickly leave and lose their deposit because living in the property is so unpleasant.

Later on, she said that only 24 hours notice was necessary and that it did not have to be at a convenient time for us. She often appeared on a Saturday morning \u2013 the most inconvenient time for those that work 9-5, 5 days a week and want to enjoy their free time. Her inspections increased, at one point, to twice a week for two weeks. We cleaned the flat regularly, but she expected the flat to be absolutely spotless \u2013 i.e. not lived in. For example, she complained several times about dust on top of the doorframes and watermarks in the sink.\n\r\n\u2022\tThe landlady would send her brother, who lived in the building, to the flat to inspect it or if we had a problem that needed fixing. He was incredibly rude and unhelpful and not what we signed up for. On one occasion he let himself into our flat without notice. It made me feel incredibly nervous living there on my own (my housemate was away a lot), knowing that he had a key.\n\r\n\u2022\tIt got to the point that I was scared to be in the flat on my own. My housemate would be away for months at a time for work and I became incredibly anxious living there, knowing that she could come over with only 24hrs notice, and that her brother had a key to the flat. \r\n\u2022\tThe tenancy agreement clearly stated that the landlord\/landlady should not infringe upon the tenants \u2018quiet enjoyment of the flat\u2019 \u2013 she did. \n\r\n\u2022\tOne Saturday, when the landlady came for an inspection, she was particularly aggressive towards me. She did not realise that my boyfriend was in my bedroom and, when he heard how rude she was being towards me, he politely asked her not to speak to me in that way. She immediately put her hand in his face saying \u2018I am not talking to you\u2019 and said that he could never visit the flat again. After this incident, Neda became convinced that we had other people living in the flat. \n\r\n\u2022\tWhen I was in the process of signing for a new flat, I was asked to give the contact details of my current landlord so that they could provide a reference. I asked the landlady\u2019s permission to do this and she asked me to ring her. On the phone, she said that I had been an awful tenant and that, to give me a good reference would be a lie. However, she said that she also wanted me gone from the flat, and so preceded to blackmail me by saying that she would only give me a good reference if I promised to get the flat professionally cleaned after moving out. Since it had been my intention to do this anyway, I agreed. Needless to say, having said that she would give me a reference, she didn\u2019t and ignored all phone calls and emails from Let Alliance when they tried to contact her for one. As a consequence, I had to provide my previous 6 months of bank statements to prove that I had paid my rent on time.\n\n\r\nI paid for the flat to be professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy. The plastic sofa had a slight rip on the seam. The DSA advised me that it was fair wear and tear as you can see where the other seam was ripping. However, the landlady said that we had to pay for a new sofa. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme clearly states that: \u201cLandlords should therefore keep in mind that the tenant\u2019s deposit is not to be used like an insurance policy where you might get \u201cfull replacement value\u201d or \u201cnew for old\u201d.\u201dIn the end she asked for \u00a3150 towards it, which we paid because, by that point we were exhausted by the back and forth arguing. \n\r\nI would be happy to provide further pictures and emails for evidence.","14":"The flat is in bad conditions, no double glazing, which means it\\'s incredibly cold and humid in the winter even with the heating on. No airflow in the summer, can\\'t get a draft in.","15":"Noisy apartment - planes and neighbor mixing pills with alcohol a couple of nights a weeks (had to call the police several times) . You cant cook as the extractor is not connected to the outlet and the fire alarm goes off with the smoke. The washing machine broke and the landlord took 2 months and a half to fix it. Not a landlord I\\'d recommend.","16":"Very nice property, suitable for a couple. Great connection to city centre via the tube, with the station literally 2 minutes from the flat. The Landlady is very nice and gets any issues sorted out fast, absolutely no problem with the deposit return. Would recommend.","17":"Extremely poor \/ no sound proofing in entire building. Inconsiderate upstairs neighbours. Shift worker who stomps around at all times of night.","18":"Fantastic property in great location but the best was Smart Rent Ltd as they were amazing assisting with any request.","19":"A Conversation apartment, difficult to live in due to noise problems.\r\n Tenants below switch TV on 8am every morning, TV stays on 13-14 hrs every day. Can clearly hear TV as well as conversations.\r\nNext door neighbour problematic old man. Refuses any discussion. His loud water pump goes off every time he uses the bathroom including multiple time throughout the night, impossible to get a nights sleep. Additionally he has a loud, buzzing fuzebox and possibly electrical issues that he refuses to fix which is possible safe issue. Fuse box makes obtrusive noise day and night. Only thin chipboard as partition wall. No sound proofing whatsoever. Neighbour can be heard retching violently day and night.\n\r\nThe apartment has no updated heating system and very low water pressure. Showering whilst standing isn\u2019t possible. Have to sit in the tub when showering- even then, very poor water pressure. Landlord has said this would be addressed but still hasn\u2019t been after 1yr plus of tenancy.\n\r\nI can not recommend renting this apartment.","20":"Flat with no lounge; mice infestation over the winter; malfunctioning kitchen exhaust system.","21":"The house itself is ok - Victorian terraced house with character. Somewhat tatty and not been refurbished for a long time with old, stained carpets and curtains, cracked paint etc. The more important issues with this property stem from the landlady (Deborah Turner) and the way in which the property was managed. The landlady lives overseas and wants little to do with the property - she appeared for a couple of hours on check in and check out. Serious issues such as a faulty gas fireplace (unsafe) were either not fixed satisfactorily, took huge amounts of correspondence and pushing or were not fixed.\n\r\nThe major issue here though is the financial management. We were able to meet the previous tenants in order to give them some mail that had arrived, they had moved locally. They said we should be very careful with the deposit when checking out, we listened but were not sure exactly what the problem was. They did say they were having to fight to get their deposit back. When we left at the end of the tenancy having looked after the property well and left it in better condition than when when we moved in, we then understood what the previous tenants meant.\n\r\nThe landlady did an inspection (before we moved out but when we were not there so could not comment on her observations) and sent a list of issues she wanted to keep money for. This was for most of the \u00a34,500 deposit. We were shocked! We replied with detailed answers to her points however she just did not respond to what she said and continued to press for money. Fortunately we had taken photographs of all issues\/marks in the house the day after we moved in - these had been emailed to the landlady at the time, and also when she raised issues upon checkout. We provide detailed explanations on each problem she wanted us to pay for, sent copies of emails with her from during he tenancy, and resent t photographs. However when repkying she chose to ignore our explanations and not respond the points made, to ignore th  photographic evidence and ignore the copies of email correspondence! For example, she wanted money for a wooden island top to be resanded - we even had a photo of the poor condition it was in when we moved in. Landlady said it had been newly sanded and varnished before we moved in - nonsense. She wanted us to pay for an aerial on the roof to be repaired - we had not even had terrestrial TV. Many other items also. It became clear she was just out to get as much money from our deposit as possible and not to consider the evidence supplied. This was very frustrating. Her communication became aggressive and inappropriately unprofessional.\n\r\nThis had to go through the dispute process with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme - we raised a case. It takes a lot of time to be thorough in contesting the landlady\\'s dishonesty point by point but the photos and email evidence we had kept every time we communicated with her meant the outcome was we were asked to pay less than \u00a3200 from the deposit instead of the \u00a34,000 she wanted. Fortunately the TDS is there to stop dishonest landlords from stealing from tenants and we were protected as a result. I would strongly recommend not renting this property as it seems the landlady tries it on at the end of all tenancies to steal money from tenants\\' deposits as they leave (as evidenced by the tenants before us, and us). It\\'s sad people like this are still allowed to rent out properties and try to take advantage of people. Fortunately we were prepared so she didn\\'t get away with it. Avoid. There are better properties for similar money in the area with far more honest landlords who act with integrity. I hope renters see this and avoid the frustration we went through, at least she didn\\'t get away with it in the end.","22":"There are at least 3 major infiltrations.\r\nTwo of them lead, after heavy rain, to water dropping from ceiling onto the floor. The other one lead to chipped paint, blistering plaster with mould. \n\r\nSingle ligthning control for living room, kitchen and terrace that enforce an indivisible consumption of more than 700 watts. \n\r\nHalogen cooktop very high consumer of electricity. \n\r\nAll the accesses to storage are not allowed. \n\r\nFoul plumbing odours need constant treatment. \n\r\nPoor window insulation in the living room and too small radiator for the large space combining the living room and the kitchen. \n\r\nProvided keys for the front door were illegal copies of Banham keys. One broke into the cylinder.","23":"The landlord kept the keys of the flat and was sending people to repare the boiler while I wasn\\'t there without 24h notice.\r\nHe also took out my break clause when he renewed the tenancy contract.\r\nThe property is not very well maintained.\r\nShower is a nightmare to clean.","24":"This property had extensive issues with heating and hot water, leaving us without hot water intermittently and without heating in over half the property for almost the entire duration. The council Environmental Health had to issue 2 serous warnings in order to have the property repaired appropriately and during the process the landlady was abusive and spiteful to us. We faced a revenge eviction, could not get a reference for our next property despite always paying rent and had to take her to small claims regarding both the improper protection of our deposit and for the disrepair. We won in mediation and the landlady had to pay us compensation. The entire process was stressful and contributed to a long period of ill health following this. I would NOT recommend this property to anyone. Despite it being repaired- at the councils instruction, the landlady is vindictive and does not attend to her property adequately.","25":"My experience with this property and its landlord has been extremely positive. The property\\'s furnishings & facilities are great and we have very rarely experienced any issues with them. Those that have come up have always been fixed or dealt with swiftly. For example, the shower door came loose and a contractor was sent to review and replace it within the space of a week. Communication has always been clear and helpful, for example if window cleaners are present on certain days. The landlord has also been accommodating of our requests, for example with placing some furniture in an on-site storage locker - and has personally helped us with this process. Overall, the property has been excellent and couldn\\'t really wish for a better landlord - this has been the most hassle free tenancy I\\'ve experienced.","26":"When moving in, the place was a mess with rubbish from the previous tenants. Among the rubbish was a used condom which would seem rather comedic had this not been the place I would be living in. The mattresses in the property where very dirty, one of the beds was partially broken causing the dirty mattress to slope down in the middle and the one of the headboards had the leather partially torn off. The light bulbs provided did not work and when the same light bulbs where put back in prior to us moving out, Landlord used this as an excuse to deduct from our deposit.\n\r\nThere where mould problems which the landlord,  would not remedy bar telling us to wipe it down with bleach. We were told the kitchen ceiling was to be painted soon after we moved in, however this didn\\&#39;t happen for the entire length of out tenancy. We where unable to use the shower due to it leaking through to the kitchen via the ceiling. The washing machines provided broke down several times and where replaced with similarly faulty ones. The lock to the stairs would get jammed preventing access to the property and needed to be removed by a neighbor. The same lock was broken for most of the tenancy.\n\r\nThere often where drug users that would hang out in the stairs leading up to the property who would leave sterile water containers used to prepare drugs for injection laying around on the stairs along with other rubbish. Along side this, the people from the hostel next door along with some neighbors would harass you as you\\&#39;re coming home. The people from the hostel and kids of the neighbors would constantly litter on the grassy area outside of the property. The kids living in the area would also leave sweet wrappers in the staircase causing one to always be met with a swarm of flies when entering going up to the property.","27":null,"28":"We were in flat 3, right at the top. Actually stayed in this property from 2009 to 2012 but it won\\'t allow me to add those dates. Nice little property at the time. Though mold and damb were an issue at times and it wasn\\'t corrected when we lived there. Otherwise a nice little starter flat for couple\/single person.","29":"This property is managed by Pure estate. Tenants stay away from Pure Estate. They will never fix any problem and you will never get back your deposit.","30":"The flat is bright and reasonably clean (it has a carpet floor so it might need some professional clean from time to time).\r\nThe landlord is a kind and available person.\r\nThe flat windows are slightly un-efficient so that sometimes it can be a bit too noisy","31":"A shared student house owned by an unreliable private landlord who took ages to fix an issue. The drainage in the shower was blocked before we moved in but the landlord put the blame on current tenants and demanded us to pay for the repair. Had issues with refunding deposits. No full tenancy contract was given although being requested, only two pages. A full year rent was required to pay by cash at the beginning of the tenancy and therefore students had no choice but to stay till the end of the contract despite poor housing condition. Cheap rental was especially appealing to new or international students who were new to the area. Students felt threatened as landlord behaved aggresively if students issued complaints about the house condition. The front door of the house which was supposed to serve as the main access to the building was broken and landlord never fixed it. The door for the kitchen of the house leading to the yard was used as the main access and the street at the back of the house was dark. These caused the house relatively unsafe to live in.","32":"The landlords are very rude and get aggressive very easily, like to blame all issues with the property on the tenant which is nigh impossible for many issues such as the roof and pointing around the house as well as rotted fences and plaster peeling away from walls. \r\nWhen made aware of issues you don\\'t hear anything for weeks usually months and you get treated very badly by them when you politely remind them or ask them about the pending repairs.\r\nThey also try to scare you out of the tenancy with threats of illegal eviction and refusal to carry out repairs. They also aren\\'t afraid to lie to authorities to try get out of any crimes they commit (such as attempted assault, illegal eviction and harassment.)","33":"This property is a house share with a private landlord who had very little regard for tenant safety, comfort or privacy. He entered rooms without advance notice or permission of any kind. He collected tenants\\' shares of bills and used the money instead for personal expenses, leaving tenants without internet access often, and, having put various accounts in various tenants\\' names, affecting their credit standing. He would make large repairs himself, despite being unqualified to do so, in order to save money. Said repairs were lacking in integrity or sustainability, and were often completed, loudly, in the wee hours of the morning. One such repair involved removing an entire window and not replacing it for two weeks, in the winter, creating a substantial security and health risk. He rented rooms the council deemed too small to be a living area. He did nothing to address infestations of mice and cockroaches. This property should be avoided at all costs.","34":"My flatmate acted in behalf of the landlord . Instead of 3 female professional living in the flat, it turned out that we were actually  5 people living in the flat. My flatmate\/landlord lied at me , suddendly she was married and also her best friend stayed with us at night in the flat !!! Her husband spent the weekends and one day of the week with us.The doors ( bedroom, sitting room, bathroom ) were left open all the time. No privacy , I could not even go to the kitchen to make  cup of tea at night because the doors were open and the noise or light would wake her up.  Utility bills were divided only by 3  instead of 5 people. We could not open the kitchen window after cooking, the dishwasher was broken , the fridge was very dirty and old, leaking  and full of ice, bins full and stinky, the list could go on and on. The worst place I have ever lived in .","35":"The landlord here will make your experience awful. Firstly he overcharges for the property (like most landlords) but what is cheeky about this landlord is the property not only is a basement with hardly any light, it also comes with problems such as damp, mould & leaking. For a whole 6 months I had to sleep in a bedroom with black mould covering the wall as the landlord took ages to do something about it. What was funny was when we started investigating the room, we could see he had simply painted over other areas where the black mould appeared. He likes to solve his problems with a plaster - minimum costs. What\u2019s worse is when we complain he begins to complain back at us stating we are difficult tenants. However, our complaints were fair, professional and polite. He clearly just didn\u2019t like a group of tenants actually making the effort to try and create change. He actually made my girlfriend feel distressed when interacting with him. At the end of our tenancy he tried to get us to pay for a full professional deep clean (from our own pockets) which costs around \u00a3100. However, at the time the new law came in that doesn\u2019t require tenants to do that anymore - so we insisted we would do it ourselves. It took us a lot of arguments to finally get him to back off. He then came to inspect the house after we finished (which was funny because he\u2019d never made the effort to come out to the house when other problems were happening). We had cleaned the house spotless so he had nothing to complain about. I do not recommend this house. It\u2019s not worth it. It\u2019s a basement, with lots of problems, no light and an awful stress inducing landlord. Go waste your money elsewhere!","36":"The place was in a terrible condition when we entered and when we complained about it they only did the minimum. We weren\\'t showed where meter reading was and it worked with a chargeable key. The place has a bathroom with sink and bathtub that need replacing.  And a separate WC","37":"this has to be the worst property we have rented i can\\'t amend the rental period as it only dates back to 2011 but we moved in here in 2008 to 2010 , the letting agents are Anglotown based in bournemouth area and i can say they are very difficult to work with almost useless , the landlord owns all 4 properties in the block , again i can only say what happened when we lived there and who owned them at the time , but when we viewed this property at first there was a wall in the backroom completely uncovered and the letting agent told us they had a problem with damp but was being fixed , we moved in and though everything was fine until the mould started to come back and it was all over in the hallway in the bedrooms and in the bathroom , it took the threat of contacting Environmental health before anyone did anything , the roof is so damp that we was told that it was in danger of collapse if nothing was done , the paper was hanging off the bedroom walls -  we reported it nothing was done the mould kept coming back we later learned on the day of moving from this property that the house had been riddled with dam for the past 80 years as a neighbour who lived in the street knew the house as a child because it use to belong to her aunt , we had a problem with a noisy neighbour who had moved in next door a couple of months after us the noise was shocking and they purposely intimidated us because we had complained over the noise levels of dance music and children jumping about , this was the final straw that broke the camel\\'s back as anglotown and the landlord didn\\'t seem to be doing anything about that either , we lost clothes and furniture because the mould had spoiled them in the time we stayed in that property and was very glad to leave , i would not ever rent from Anglotown again.","38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":"The flat is a one double bedroom, with bathroom, open-plan kitchen and living room and a cupboard. It is managed by a letting agency (currently Edward Taub) and the owner does not wish to deal with tenants directly. It is well maintained overall, but in need of TLC and some upgrades. The selling points: it is light thanks to 4 windows. Downsides: drafts, noisy neighbours, difficulty in keeping it warm, yearly rent increases. \r\nThe flooring is nice in the corridor and living room, where you find a light wood laminate flooring, and also in the kitchen area, with dark tiles. Where it needs fixing: cracked tiles in the lavatory and extremely consumed carpet in the bedroom. The flat has a C EPC rating on paper but while it does have double glazing, window frames are old and there are drafts from around every window (and from underneath the bath tub!). The flat has two storage heaters (living room and corridor) and one regular heater in the bedroom. Due to the inefficiency of storage heating, the flat results tricky to keep warm (and even more difficult is to replace air during the day, because you\\'d lose all heath). The landlord complained that all tenants find them difficult to operate, which is why a third storage heater in the bedroom was replaced with a normal heater. The storage heater in the corridor is positioned directly underneath the opening to the rooftop, which is separated by a flimsy piece of wood (read: the heat goes straight up and is dispersed too easily). Two light fixtures (living room and bedroom) leave holes in the ceiling exposed. The bedroom is a very small double (I could not add a headboard to the bed because it wouldn\\'t leave enough room to walk around the bed) with very consumed brown carpet which is clean, but should be replaced as time has clearly eaten it away. A built-in closet completes the room, but a regular closet would have been much better (the closet is awkwardly organized) and could have sliding doors to maximize space) and a big rod with brown curtains. \r\nThe bathroom is functional with tub and electric shower and a very old down flow electric heater that looks like something from the 80s (read: never tested due to safety concerns). There are no windows in the bathroom , only a noisy fan connected to the light switch. The living room\/kitchen area is nice and the three windows give it plenty of light. The sun hits the window only in the early morning, so it does not help to warm up the rooms. The kitchen has generous cabinet space and has an open plan, with an island against the wall (but not enough counter to use stools). The small fridge unit was replaced at the beginning of the tenancy because the previous tenant had broken the door of the freezer unit. No dishwasher. The washer is a Hotpoint Aquarius WD420 and unfortunately only works with pre-set programs (can\\'t select water temperature and speed of spin cycle). The electric hobs are also need tlc: there are no marks whatsoever, so it is hard to figure which way to turn the knobs and some of the indicators telling which hob you\\'re using also don\\'t work  (all brought up to the attention of letting agency\/owner at the beginning of tenancy but owner preferred not to replace it). There is an oven (never used, so can\\'t comment on it) and an extractor fan.\r\nNeighbours are on the noisy side: nexdoor is a crying baby and a child who loves to scream, including at odd hours (1 am!!!) and downstairs neighbours like to play loud music in the afternoons. Had to call police 3 times in the first year for outside disturbances from the building directly in front of 7 Thurlow. No problems the following year, but expect kids playing football against the walls of the building and smoke seeping through doors and windows even though it is banned. Complained about smell of weed (on a daily basis), but nothing ever done. New storage bin area installed and fenced area for laundry were added after the first year: very nice additions. Some tenants\/guests have problems understanding how the magnetic door to the building works (must push a button and then push the door), so it was damaged twice in two years, possibly another reason for the yearly rent increases. \r\nAll and all a good temporary accommodation. The letting agency is always willing to help.","43":null,"44":"The property is nice and the landlord gets things fixed, but there is an issue with huge spiders, so DO NOT LIVE HERE if you have a spider phobia. Regularly, there was a thick spider the size of my palm in the bathroom and kitchen and there were other big, thick spiders in the other rooms. The landlord hired pest control to spray the rooms with insecticide, but this only worked for a coupe of months.","45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":"A group of us from queen mary university re yes this lovely refurbed 6 bedroom house which had a HMO which was very difficult to find in Mile End \n\r\nThe property was amazing to live in and had huge bedrooms throughout with 3 bedrooms which had en-suite \n\r\nThe letting agent was reiss samuels. When we moved into the house we met with the landlord Mr Rakesh Patel and his assistant  who explained to us all that if we have any issues they were a call away\n\r\nWe only lived here for 12 months as we all split up which was a shame as we had one more year at university I would rate the property a 9\/10 and the landlord Mr Rakesh patel a 9\/10 he promised what he said we even messaged him once at 2am in the morning and he replied back then as one of us got stuck in the bathroom \n\r\nLovely house and lovely landlord thanks Rakesh patel","49":"This is a fantastic property to rent. It has very quiet families upstairs and below with easy free parking on the street outside the property. The flat has everything you need (all utensils and fully furnished).

Trust me this is one of the best flats out there.","50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":"No major issues that went unfixed.\r\nThe electrician who installed the lights installed them so the wiring was being burned through, but after a photographing the issue the landlord got an electrician around to replace it. \n\r\nThe lock managed to latch while I was outside, requiring a locksmith, but I believe the locksmith concluded it was an issue with the lock used, and replaced it same day.\n\r\nThe RCD will sometimes trip when running the washing machine. This has been brought up with the landlord multiple times, but as a source can\\'t be identified, this is still an ongoing issue. Though less frequent since turning off the immersion heater. The only time it has tripped has been when the washing machine has been running for what it\\'s worth.\n\r\nThe kitchen is in the centre of the property, so gets no direct natural light. Only through a small window that\\'s connected to the hallway opposite the door to the property, with an equally small window going to the stairwell. Or from the corridor\/connecting room itself. Generally you\\'re going to need the light on return using the kitchen.\n\r\nThe location is decently close to things - only about a fifteen minute walk to the centre of town, or to east Croydon station. The road itself can get quite busy and usually has some traffic. Being a converted building in a fairly industrial location, it\\'s not the most obviously residential place.","54":"Whilst we lived there we had a massive leak which took over 6 months to get sorted, mainly as the landlord and the building manager kept passing responsibility back and forth. This caused a mould issue. When we moved out, we were given a bill for double the deposit held: essentially the landlord had redecorated the house completely and was trying to charge us for it (to a total of more than \u00a33,600). We had to take him to court as he refused to follow the legal guidelines for what is expected for deposit use, and after a year and three months of legal proceedings he agreed to a deal where we paid the \u00a3200 pound original deposit offer we had suggested when we moved out, and he returned the rest of the deposit. I would watch out with this property as the landlord is likely to try the same trick of massively inflated deposit requests with any future tenant. His requests were completely baseless, for example trying to charge 250 quid for a bed frame I found online for 50 pounds. It was a long, unpleasant and expensive process and the apartment isn\\'t nice enough to justify dealing with a landlord like that.","55":"House is of very poor construction, no insulation, heating barely works; the house is never warm no matter how high and for how long the heating is on. Decades old bathroom fittings that are rotten and rife with mold due to botched attempts at DIY repair by the landlord. Discourteous and dishonest landlord. During tenancy put up with: unaddressed mold problems, unaddressed broken kitchen fittings and unsanitary mold on worktops, disrespectful and rude communication, illegal intrusion.","56":"The house is situated in a nice and quiet area with an allocated parking.  The area is very convenient for a couple with children.  Re locating from the city ( London ) we have been conquered by the conservatory that makes one additional room during the summer ( extremely convenient to dry clothes as the washing machine does not offer the dryer option ).  Unfortunately during the winter ( from November to April ) this additional room can not be used ( to cold and wet to dry clothes ) and unless considering using a heater in the room ( at a cost! ) it won\\'t be possible to use that room other than during the daylight.  Except for the conservatory, the hall, the kitchen and the bathroom, all the surface of the house is cover by carpet what is not the most convenient to clean ( particularly with children ).  From our opinion, the mistake is to have installed carpet on the living room were it would have been much more advisable to install laminated floor.  The main issue with that property is the agency managing the property, Simon and Miller in Larkfield ( Maidstone ).  We have a couple of years experience in renting properties but this agency is from far the poorest agency we never had to deal with.  Up to now, they charged us ( the cost have been added to our online account and i assume they are expecting to deduct the costs from our deposit by the end of the tenancy ) for 3 allegedly non necessary requests of assistance charged \u00a372, \u00a340 and \u00a348.  We tried to discuss the issue but we have always been shut down and told we will have to pay.  The attitude of the agency is disdainful and patronizing and is the real hassle of renting this property.  Regarding the repairs, the agency is unable to solve urgent problem efficiently:  when we moved in the property, the sink plug was stuck half closed and it took the agency\/ the landlord 9 months to replace it.  We had issue with the lock of the doors between the conservatory and the living room that was not closing and told it won\\'t be changed.  We had issue with the front door lock.  We had issue with the oven ( it has just been replaced 3 months after we reported the fault ).  Another important mistake regarding the energy consumption: the thermostat is located in the hall where the ( open ) stairway is located.  Without a permanent manual adjustment, the heating is always working: it\\'s too hot upstairs and barely warm downstairs.  I will say the property is a very nice house but the attitude of the managing agency ( Simon and Miller in Larkfield ) is terrific.","57":null,"58":"The bath has regular problems with leaking downstairs, only temporary fixes were provided.\n\r\nThere was no Sky communal point in the flat, took a couple of months and lots of chasing to get this installed, had to take many days off with no result.

You can hear the very heavy  traffic especially at rush hour from the surrounding streets. The flat gets the sun in the morning so quite nice on summer days where the flat faces another block it is a little cooler. There are holiday lettings within the vicinity. The trouble is they can keep you awake late at night and wake you up early in the morning due to residents of these arriving and leaving the car park which is directly beneath the bedroom. The landlord wanted to charge me for things that were on the inventory when I moved in and for cleaning the property when it was vacated. The arbitration service went in my favour. Leaders Poole, who let the property did not fully discuss the no deposit scheme (do no go for this, pay a deposit. You will be better protected). After you leave the letting agents (Leaders) will take ages to answer emails, sometimes over a month. They seem to be only interested in protecting the landlords money and property.

Landlord tried to take a tenant owned mattress claiming that it was in their house so they could take it, hole in ceiling which they claimed was for ventilation, spent all valentines day at the flat ruining all house mates date plans with loved ones as they didn\\'t want to go home, shouting at tenants and visitors to the house, all house problems were our fault including the severe damp caused by the roof leaking into rooms, unannounced visits and generally unpleasant to name a few things.\n\r\nWhen we moved out we had a lot of problems dealing with the landlord. Out of 13 years in living in rented properties this was probably the worst year ive had mainly due to the Landlord. The problems of the house were dealable to a certain extent just I will never rent a property from them again. \n\r\nNext door to the property is a house that can see clearly into the kitchen. For the first few months this wasn\\'t a problem but then the house was bought by a live in care home. After that point there were multiple points where loud arguing shouting and swearing could be heard. However its understandable given the situation and lets face it if your living in a city then noisy neighbors are to be expected.\n\r\nWe were also robbed within the first month of living in the property, housemate left the window open went to make a cup of tea to find someone had jumped through the window, grabbed a bunch of laptops and jumped back out again.\n\r\nAlso two kids across the road used to like hanging out of the windows shouting racist abuse at people walking past on a frequent basis.\n\r\nNo parking in the area with heavy congestion and noise as situated next to a busy road.\n\r\nNice garden though.","72":"The property was in excellent condition with very good amenities. The location is excellent but very very busy especially on match days. The owner let out the house to us as he was fed up of london and moving out of the country to start a business in another country. He knocked of several \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 from the rent and it was a good deal. A month after we moved in, we started getting regular visits from the police and bailiffs looking for the owner to recover debts. There were lots of letters that came in the name of the owner and his family members which were seized by the police. The police and bailiffs were very polite and did not harass us but we did not want to deal with his mess and have them coming so often looking for the owner. During our moving notice period, we got to know that the owner had missed his mortgage payments and the house was going to be repossessed so it was a good thing we decided to move earlier. We are yet to receive our deposit which was not protected.","73":"After signing our tenancy agreement and moving in we were informed that at some point in 2016 the elevation of the property would be repaired, we soon discovered that this meant that throughout the winter months when it rained the inside walls in our bedroom were left severely damp and often wet to the touch. This coupled with a broken radiator in the bedroom that the landlord categorically refused to have repaired meant our bedroom was permanently damp, and weekly we had to clean the mould from the walls. Eventually we forfeited the last month of our tenancy and moved out... interestingly 2 months later the flat doesn\\'t appear to have new tenants.","74":null,"75":"7 years of loyalty with this landlord. \u00a360,000 in rent paid. To start with he was really good. However. Having been stung by a tennant for \u00a311,000 he took this out on us. During the pandemic he was rude and unsympathetic that our newbuild was not ready and repeatedly asked when we were leaving andvto tell the builders to get a move on (mmmmm pandemic Mr LL).  He had the house on the market and we courteously showed people round ensuring the house was clean. When we moved out he wanted a months rent notice (fair doos) so basicaly he had an empty property for which we were still paying. When we moved in it had old carpets from a previous family and needed painting and decorating but we decided to do this ourselves to a tasteful manner. The property had cheap carpets fixtures and fittings such as fireplace, kitchen and taps. Wooden floor was of good standard. Reported a leak which was promtly fixed but the damage it caused was left. Several windows were full of condensation causing wallpaper to be damp and peel. Front and back door repeatedly leaked when it rained but got told that they are not meant to be water tight (what????) Cheap kitchen kick boards would never stay on. Cheap carpet use to get tangled in the hoover. Pleasant area with pleasant neighbours thankfully because he only put up a 4ft fence to save money. Garden waste bin was full when we moved in, but charged us a years subscription to get it emptied.\n\r\n\u00a30 bond given back and never used a deposit company for us to be able to dispute.

Used his poor elderly father as a maintenance man even sending him in during a pandemic.\n\r\nI would suggest avoiding this very bitter money grabbing man.","76":null,"77":"I had rented the property from Foxtons but the flat was managed by landlady. The landlady was extremely unco-operative and all throughout I found her attitude very unpleasant. The flat was practically uninhabitable with 2 window locks of bedrooms broken and not being able to shut the windows at all. In addition the balcony door handle was broken and the door would not shut properly letting in winds. The showers of both baths were not working. Ensuite shower had a temperature regulation problem and the other had a broken shower. Overall the condition was pretty unpleasant with chipped doors, cupboards, mouldy washing machine, dirty commode and the flat was handed to me unclean. The window used to let in winds and I suffered greatly because of that. Initially she did not agree to do any repairs but after the agent intervened she did fix one shower that was broken, and the window locks were changed in Mid December after 4 months. The balcony door she refused to fix and even acknowledge it to be a problem. The door would not seal cold air and I fell ill with pneumonia for the second time very badly. After this I asked the Foxtons to convey the message to the landlady that either she fixed the door or she lets me break the contract earlier, as the contract didn\\'t have a break clause. If I have to stay in that flat in that condition I would complaint to the council. The agent got back to me saying that the lady had agreed to that I could terminate the contract earlier. However upon vacating she had claimed falsely and unjustly about damages that was already there in the first place and for leaving the property unclean. I felt this to be very unfair and dishonest on her part to act like this. Overall I found the flat to be completely unpleasant to live in because of the hostile attitude of the landlady and her issues with repairs and was overpriced. I would rate the property 1 star \u2b50 and landlady rating is not even applicable.","78":"The floors are so squeaky that you can hear the upstairs neighbour very loudly, making it really hard to sleep.

I am showing her proof of email and picture thats its an old one but she didnt respond at all. Purple brick is the agency who does the paper work but they are also same. I am sending SMS\/email to both purplebrick and Landlord Tolu but no response, still struggling for my deposit. Other Tenant should be careful from this trap in this property. Tenant likes the location but be careful.","87":"Jacks Cottage is a beautiful stone structure with a fascinating history as an ostler\\'s attached to the larger house next to it which was a pub and is where the Landlord and Landlady live.\n\r\nIt has been extended and modernised and has space and light in the extended portion but is very cramped upstairs and in the shower room downstairs. The shower room is directly opposite the front door and was full of dirt when I moved in. The bathroom upstairs is very low and also small and had leaks due to poor plumbing.\n\r\nThe location has fantastic scenery, and the towns in the area a joy to visit. You need a car to live here, but two spaces on a new driveway are provided. However, the cottage was very difficult to find due to the lack of a sign at the entrance. It took me eight months to condense the directions into 200 characters to allow delivery drivers to locate the property. It is close to Bristol, but the roads become packed at peak hours. However, this is similar to many other cities. There are always multiple routes into Bristol if there is an accident, and the property is well situated for access to the M4\/M5 for longer commutes.\n\r\nUnfortunately, the road beside the cottage is used by HGV lorries and commuters as a shortcut to avoid a busy junction on the M5. There are also four quarries in the local area, and the road is used 3-4 nights a week for overnight quarry lorry convoys which pass every 20 minutes or so. Being an old building, it had no foundations which meant the convoys were so loud and caused such vibrations that a picture of my children fell off the wall and was severely damaged. The downstairs windows are double glazed, as are the Velux windows in the upstairs bathroom and hall but the bedroom windows are very old and single paned due to health and safety fire rules.\n\r\nAlthough the property seemed clean inside, when I looked closer after moving in, it was filthy behind the cooker, the shower required days of work to even get it to a point where I could use it.\n\r\nThe heating is oil based, and your bills will fluctuate with oil prices, it also more work monitoring oil levels and ordering deliveries. The property was tough to keep at a constant temperature due to incorrect radiator sizing and lack of central room thermostat. Despite offering to have one installed by my brother for free, the landlord and landlady prevaricated and would not accept that the cottage needed one. My brother is a 25-year heating and airconditioning technical expert who runs his own company, and the local heating engineer even mentioned that he could not understand why they did not install central thermostats in the cottage or the main house and then complained that the heating was expensive and that breakdowns were regular. A central thermostat would have mitigated both of these problems.\n\r\nThere is a tiny garden with astroturf, but it is very private with a large stone wall around it.\n\r\nThe lighting is mostly spotlights, banks of 4 in each bedroom upstairs. Personally, I think the lighting design is not good. Too bright and direct but that is a subjective opinion. I replaced many halogen bulbs with LED equivalents out of my pocket due to the cost and heat generated having them on. \n\r\nThe landlord and landlady, while being pleasant, were both working full time. Thereofre, any request for minor repairs was not attended to or repaired poorly by themselves or me. They did not want to spend the money on professional workmen for interior maintenance. Their amateur attitude was also a factor in the cleanliness of the property was not subject to deep cleaning for many years over many tenancies. \n\r\nAs I expected the owners tried to take a good portion of the deposit from me, that was due to damage caused by issues I had verbally pointed out but were not resolved. I won the Deposit Protection Scheme arbitration that I entered due to problems with the contract and their lack of reactivity when I mentioned issues. I recommend you very carefully check everything on their manual list of the state of the interior.In addition, take photo\\'s of every room, every item, in every cupboard and behind every appliance if you decide to move in. When raising issues, make sure they are via email or in writing and keep them for future proof.\n\r\nThe privacy is severely lacking due to the main house right next to you. I noticed I was being watched but ignored it until multiple visitors mentioned it to me. I suggest you get net curtains, which of course darkens the property as the sun shines through the windows on the side of the cottage where the main building is located.\n\r\nMy overall experience was generally very poor, and caused me incredible extra stress that I did not need at that time.","88":"The property had mould and black mould, complaints of this to the landlord were fobbed off each time.\n\r\nWhen we moved out our furniture was mouldy. \n\r\nThe landlord was unprofessional, un-accommodating, petty and at times harrassing. \n\r\nWhen we moved out, the landlord messaged me on e-mail, text and whatsapp almost daily late in the evening causing me stress and being unable to sleep due to worry. \n\r\nThe exterior of the building was in a state of disrepair, but she did nothing about it. \n\r\nI was very glad to leave this place.","89":null,"90":"The Landlord failed to act on reports of rats for the entire tenancy. The rats were repeatedly seen within this property and the neighbouring property which the landlord also owns, and caused damage to the property. The landlord tried to blame the tenants for the issue, failed to do anything to fix the issue, and the tenants had to report it to environmental health who stated that the landlord and agent (HAART Lettings Cambridge) were being neglectful.\n\r\nThe landlord failed to fix damage that the tenants paid to repair, only provided a partial refund towards the end of the tenancy, and is now trying to reclaim more than the originally quoted amount from our deposit. The landlord has also lied to the tenancy dispute service about what the tenant said caused the damage.\n\r\nThe landlord failed to register the boiler of the neighbouring property which he also owns, which put our health at risk.","91":"Property was not up to today\\'s standards in terms of electrical wiring\/safety. This was the reason why we were given notice when the agency realised the precarious use of extension leads for basic appliances.

The house has been back so soon on the market that i don\\'t believe the work has been done. \r\nVery basic kitchen for that monthly rental. Did not find agent helpful (only works for landlord) and landlady was particularly unresponsive to any request even to visit to see the state of the house.

To our knowledge, the landlord is not planning to make any changes or refurbishments to these items. \n\r\nOur letter:\n\r\n\\\"We\u2019ve noticed the following issues in the unit that have arisen from normal wear and tear or defects in furnishings, which you might want to consider before re-letting:\n\r\n- The damp in the corner of the bedroom (refer to earlier communication) still appears to be soaking through the walls. Perhaps this is still damp from the earlier leak. Regardless, real issue is that mould is still growing inside the walls. It is still possible to smell the mould and damp. (My wife was diagnosed with adult-onset asthma only after this damp appeared, and her ongoing breathing difficulties appear to be triggered by the black mould in the bedroom). The mouldy wall is a health and safety concern.\n\r\n-The carpet in the unit is very worn, especially around doorsills. It is fraying at many places where the carpet meets the walls, and where the carpet meets the doors, in multiple rooms. There was a duct-taped section keeping the carpet together when we first moved to the property, and now we have added several duct-tape additions of our own in places where opening doors pull at the carpet. This has been necessary to keep the carpet from getting caught under doors and fraying further.\n\r\n-Many other interior doors do not close properly, particularly the door to the bedroom with the round wall and the lounge with the fireplace.\n\r\n- The tray containing the electric hobs in the kitchen, which once fell out of position (refer to our earlier communication about this problem), has been imperfectly reinstalled and sits somewhat lower than it should. This creates a problem where the heating elements do not sit flush with the glass, making the heat uneven and cooking more difficult.\n\r\n- The boiler spontaneously shuts off from time to time, frequently requiring the relight button to be pressed. This is particularly an issue when it goes off in the night, leaving the house without heat while we are sleeping. \n\r\n- The freezer door latch has broken, making the freezer not close properly and resulting in frost buildup. Normal defrosting does not seem to solve the problem. It is nearly impossible to use the freezer, and the open freezer compartment makes the refrigerator section too cold. \n\r\n- The washing machine sometimes apparently does not receive sufficient water, causing the wash cycle to frequently stop with a \u201ctap closed\u201d error. \n\r\n- The bathroom sink had a stuck drain which was partially repaired, but we were instructed not to close the drain until further repairs could be made.\n\r\n- A smell often comes out of the bathroom sink when you use the taps. Your handyman told us at one point that this was normal, but the smell is quite strong and sulfuric, and only comes when you turn on the water. \n\r\n- The right knob on the bathroom sink has been gradually reducing the amount of water it will deliver from the tap. Over the last few months it\u2019s gone from letting out about half of what the left knob will deliver, to just a trickle of water. Right now almost no water comes out of the right knob when you turn it.\\\"\n\r\n--\n\r\nIn addition this letter, it should be noted that most of the windows do not shut properly (the flat is part of a historic house, and the windows are original and not double glazed), and insects regularly fly into the flat, since it\\'s surrounded by parkland on three sides. We\\'ve had particular problems with wasps and spiders.\n\r\nOn the positive side, the landlord is very quick at responding to emails. However, he is very slow to make any necessary updates to the property. In the first instance, he will come personally or send a handyman to see what kind of \\\"patch\\\" can be made. If he can\\'t figure out a good quick-fix or patch for the problem, then you should expect a long delay for a fix (for example, two weeks for a new washing machine for us, and he\\'s never corrected a problem with the sink).\n\r\nAn example: the old hobs in the very old hob\/oven unit (probably last updated in the 1970s)  *collapsed and fell through the oven* earlier this year. Instead of fixing the unit, his handyman patched the hob by rigging it sloppily back up under the glass. Now the hobs don\\'t sit straight, so it\\'s really difficult to cook (and not all of the cooking options on the hob\/oven unit worked in the first place). This is an example of a \\\"patch\\\" job.\n\r\nYet another example - and the most critical one - when a damp issue was identified, and black mould was found growing on the walls in the master bedroom, the landlord simply had his handyman come over and slap stain remover and paint on the problem. The water leaked through over and over again, and the mould kept growing. This led to me developing asthma and breathing problems (as noted on the list above). To this date, the landlord seems to have no plan to actually fix the problem, and merely keeps having his handyman come by and hide the mould and damp stains under another coat of paint. It\\'s a serious health and safety problem.\n\r\nFinal example - the carpet is ancient. When we moved into the property (as mentioned above), we noticed the carpet was already old, that it was fraying where the doors close, and that there was grey tape keeping some of the carpet in place. Fast forward to now - the carpet is of course worse after another year and eight months of wear and tear. It\\'s frayed or pulling back, revealing the plywood underneath, when you close nearly all of the doors. Despite being on its last leg, it\\'s clear the landlord wants us to keep the old carpet for his next tenant. When we noted that the carpet was really old and frayed (and frankly disgusting as well), he just sent in a handyman to add more tape to tape the carpet down under the doors - but, hey, it\\'s black tape this time! This is especially frustrating in our last days of the tenancy, since obviously the doors still pull at the carpet which is now covered in black tape, and of course the tape is sticky and it catches to the door when we close them. So this tape \\\"patch\\\" has just left us with a sticky mess and even more frayed carpet. I can\\'t imagine how he thinks the next tenant will be okay with living with taped-down carpet.\n\r\nThese are just illustrations of how the landlord \\\"does business.\\\" When the paint peels or a crack appears, he sends in a handyman who does a pretty sloppy job. When our rent is 2800 pounds a month, you\\'d expect he could move a bit quicker and afford a new washing machine or hob or carpet...\n\r\nFinally, to add insult to injury, when the estate agent started showing prospective tenants to the flat this week, the tenants were of course turned off by the flat. Our landlord had the nerve to write me this letter, insulting us and presuming that *we* were to blame for the flat not being rented on its first viewing:  \r\n\\\"please can I ask that you keep the property tidy and presentable for any viewings (as I am sure you will do in any case!) so that I can tie up a re-let ASAP and minimise the need for further viewings which will be to our mutual benefit.\\\"\n\r\nI of course responded: \\\"Our house was impeccably clean when the last visitation took place, and it will be for any further viewings. As we were present during the last viewing, we heard the prospective tenant make comments about the condition of the property, particularly the frayed carpet that Trevor has taped, and noticed that the flat has not been updated recently. We are always committed to keeping and presenting a tidy flat.\\\"\n\r\nSo, tenants beware: if you rent this property, your landlord will not only refuse to maintain it, but he expects you to pay a luxury rent for a run-down place, and will blame *you* no one wants to rent it after you.\n\r\nIn sum, the landlord runs this property like a cheap hostel but wants to charge a luxury rent. After he raised our rent this year, were left paying an exorbitant rent of 2800 pounds - and we felt stuck there because we had a newborn baby and were desperate not to move. As soon as we got our bearings, we went out and searched the market and found newly refurbished (clean and HEALTHY) properties in as great locations for 800 pounds less a month. We immediately terminated our lease using the break clause as soon as we found a new living situation. \n\r\nWe\\'ve since learned that our landlord expects to fetch a rent of 3500 pounds a month for the place. We find this shocking.","102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":"Great landlords.","109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":"The flat became overwhelmingly mouldy and yet the landlady did nothing, eventually bullying us and turning around on her responsibilities.

The landlord was elderly and liked talking about the war, but that was no excuse for the disrepair of this property and his refusal and excuses to help.\n\r\nWe spent 26 months in this property and I\\'m going to list just some of the issues that still stick out to me now after all this time;\r\n- There was mold throughout the property, mainly in the bathroom, kitchen and small bedroom. To address it an extractor fan was installed in the bathroom. Previously, there was a hole in the wall in preparation of a fan, but no actual fan installed. An extractor was added to the drier in the kitchen. Previously it had just been pumping out all that steam into the kitchen. These 2 amends did not solve the issue. \r\n- The landlord would enter the property without warning and without us present. I once came home from work to find the property stinking. It turned out he\\'d been round to spray mould remover on the walls, but didn\\'t then wash it off. \r\n- The living room window was installed upside down. As a result, you need to get a ladder to climb up and release the lock in order to close it once open. As this is a first floor flat, this is dangerous. His fix for this was to permanently seal it shut using the same sealant you would generally use in the bathroom. \r\n- The carpets had holes in them, paint splatter on them, and weren\\'t tacked down. Where they were tacked down, in doorways for example, they were loose and we would literally cut out feet or rip our socks on them, so you have to wear shoes or slippers at all times. \r\n- There\\'s a rotting mattress in the garden. We were assured it would be removed when we moved in, but it was still there when we moved out. \r\n- The 2 sheds were overflowing with the previous tenants belongings, including a sofa when we moved in. These were emptied, initially... \r\n- The attic was also full to the brim. To empty this, he sent round a gardener with a van. The van wasn\\'t big enough. So, we helped the man fill the van (this would have been an impossible one man job, as the attic access was just a hatch and he was having to move wardrobes, doors, tables etc). Once the van was full, we then stuffed the overflow into the sheds, and that still only cleared half the attic space, which at least allowed us to store a few bits.\r\n- The landlord was a bully. He would have me in tears when he came round, telling me how difficult I was making his life because I had asked for the mould issue to be resolved. I told him I was getting ill. He would just raise his voice. So we left. 4 months later I had my cancer diagnosis. Mould (as far as I know) doesn\\'t cause cancer, but I do believe if I\\'d have been forced to remain in that house through chemo, I probably would have died.\r\n- He sent a roofer to look at the living room window, who unsurprisingly wasn\\'t able to fix it. He sent a gardener to look at the roof. He sent an electrician to look at the boiler. It was as if he was determined to not fix anything, but to look like he was trying and just \\\"couldn\\'t find the right people\\\".\r\n- We were told we could use the drive out front. You can\\'t. It belongs to the lady who lives downstairs. Street parking is scares. After a month there I gave up and sold my car. \r\n- Plug sockets, light switches and the thermostat were painted over. The sockets were literally full of paint, so half of them didn\\'t work. One had blown completely. There was evidence of burning and melting and the live wire just left. Other sockets had been illegally installed, as we found out after an inspection, and the illegal fittings were removed, which further halfed our plug capacity in the living room. He never fixed the thermostat. \r\n- The oven was an electric oven, but used a regular plug socket, which you could literally feel heat up as you used it. This oven did break while we were tenants, which we then replaced with a safe gas cooker. \r\n- The boiler was condemned and no action was taken.\r\n- At some point in the past the living room had been wall papered. By the time we moved in, the wall paper had been painted over in a garish green. We wondered why. Then realised it was because there were in total 5 fist sized holes in the wall, that had been ductaped over and then the walls painted.\r\n- The fireplace had been stuffed with rubbish and then sealed shut with cardboard and ductaped. I literally don\\'t even know how they achieved that one. \n\r\nBasically, this property is an absolute disaster and this man shouldn\\'t be allowed to be a landlord. \n\r\nThere were plenty of other, smaller issues that we fixed ourselves, and we managed the mould issue with a lot of regular scrubbing. Overall, the property was in a much better state when we left than when we moved in. Despite this, he tried to keep \u00a3800 of the \u00a31250 deposit. We argued and provided photographic evidence in a very lengthy document to the deposit protection scheme and in the end this was reduced to just \u00a340 - because we left a perfectly good BBQ behind! The \u00a340 was apparently for the removal of this item, despite the fact it would have cost him nothing to either a) take it to a skip, b) offered it to the next tenants or c) bulked it in with the removal of the rotting mattress, the contents of the sheds and the remaining contents of the attic. Still, this was a battle I didn\\'t need while dealing with breast cancer and we did well to recover the majority of our deposit back.\n\r\nIf you have any other option available to you, I would recommend you avoid this house.","117":"Boiler has not been working properly since we moved in. It overheats every couple of days. Several engineers have advised that it needs replacing but landlord has refused. When we got advice from engineer in writing saying it needed replacing, he accused us of pressuring engineer into writing misleading email. One engineer even told us that he knows this property and the boiler has been broken for years, but the landlord just doesn\\'t want to pay for a new one.\n\r\nSerious dry rot in one of the bedrooms under the skirting boards. Landlord has said it is because we sometimes hang laundry indoors (eg when it is raining outdoors) and that therefore we need to pay for dry rot to be fixed.

The kitchen is small but perfectly formed, plenty of space to store the essentials - we sometimes found the fridge\/freezer a struggle (under cabinet size only) after a big shop, but with a bit of careful arrangement it easily housed enough food for two! The living room was a great size and the compact table was perfect for space saving.Our favourite feature of the flat was the wall of shelving! This was an amazing use of the space and gave us all the storage we needed! We love the area (we bought a place across the park from Coleman Court) but as any Londoner will tell you no area is perfect - but we really never had any problems that affected us personally.

He then proceeded to blackmail us into giving up an enormous portion of the deposit even though (after 7 years of the property being let since the last inventory was done) he was entitled to relatively little. Chris could not be reasoned with by explaining to him how betterment works under the UK law, and his only responses were to tell us how bored he was of our requests, aggressive messages highlighting random sections of the tenancy agreement and threats of legal action. He cannot be reasoned with and, like many landlords, his greed became all too apparent at the end of the tenancy. I suggest that Chris takes a hard look in the mirror to consider why he should take tenants cash for basic maintenance (like painting a wall long after it\u2019s usable life span is up) rather than paying for it out of the roughly \u00a3280k he has collected in rent since the last time these jobs were done. He also didn\u2019t want to replace things like broken fridge shelves that on the original (seven year old) inventory were showing cracks due to age and repair. He was, however, generally good with other items of repair (such as when plumbing broke and the bathroom flooded) although I suspect that was only because that threatened the material value of the home. Never did one inspection in all the time we lived there either. In short, parasitic and partially absent landlord who views the house as a passive source of guaranteed cash rather than something to be genuinely lived in and then later maintained by him on the basis it\u2019s an investment.","144":null,"145":"This property had extensive issues with heating and hot water, leaving us without hot water intermittently and without heating in over half the property for almost the entire duration.

We faced a revenge eviction, could not get a reference for our next property despite always paying rent and had to take her to small claims regarding both the improper protection of our deposit and for the disrepair. We won in mediation and the landlady had to pay us compensation. The entire process was stressful and contributed to a long period of ill health following this. I would NOT recommend this property to anyone. Despite it being repaired- at the councils instruction, the landlady is vindictive and does not attend to her property adequately.","146":"In my experience the Landlords were A star. We had our own gardener, handyman and the landlords provided their own British Gas homecare account for any boiler, gas, plumbing, electrical or water issues. The house did get cold in the winter as the fireplaces had not been closed. The landlords tried to remedy this by introducing carpets in the upstairs bedrooms and installing new radiators. \n\r\nThere were no rent hikes in our time there and after the first year we ended up on a rolling 2 month contract. \n\r\nThe rear garden and patio area was a pleasure in the summer.

The property was not registered as a flatshare so agents started an investigation. They discovered that the name of the landlord doesn\\'t match with the home address he gave. We also faced electric issue. The heater didn\\'t work so we received an electric one for our room. Because of the electricity issues, it was cut off regularly and we had to go downstairs to put it back on. Thing is, we didn\\'t have the key to go downstairs qt first so our food in the fridge and freezer turned bad. Also, the switch didn\\'t make sense so we had to use our flashlights sometime to find our way around. Some sockets were missing that it was impossible to vacuum the living room. The house was also badly painted, especially for the details. I met a Romanian worker who live in another property from this landlord. He told me that he was rushed to finish quickly and roughly the house work. The landlord blamed me for not being British (he is from China). As mentioned here above, we also had mould issue that was covered up with the painting and leak that was poorly repaired. The landlord contacted us only to get his rent but didn\\'t get any repairs done. He was coming back and forth in the house with other people without 24h notice. He also randomly decided to add public lights in the property. So we had a constant green light in or ceiling.","163":"This is a great property.

Despite keeping windows ajar every day I was still required to do a deep clean with strong mould spray every so often.  I lost several pairs of shoes and clothes to the mould issue.  Despige flagging this with the landlord several times, promises were made and nothing that made a vast change was done (only a replastering of a cupboard).\n\r\nThe landlord\\'s handyman on retainers informed me that the house does not have any insulation!

Said handyman was brought in to fix.  A year later, the roof collapsed without warning!

The kitchen floor has cheap bathroom lino on it so that when you put your fridge and washing machine down it tears it. the side is none scratch resistant or heat proof, it was all warn out by the time we moved out, top room was un-usable in winter because there is a hole in the wall to the outside covered with a plastics grate - kitchen floor poorly fitted holes connected to the basement, cold drafts- basement door has hole at the top letting in draft. - loads of spiders coming from basement, enough to constitute an infestation.

It underlines the importance of taking pictures when you move in. I believe that the we could have gotten more back if we had done this.\n\r\nIt is not all doom and gloom the landlords do repairs quickly if they are cheap - they use unskilled work men though.\n\r\nThe boiler broke down in November 2018 - and to their credit they replaced it.

We reported a dangerous loft hatch which wasn\\'t fixed properly and kept falling down, we were advised that the landlord would have their handyman repair it, but this never happened.I would just recommend to any tenant wishing to take on this property, definitely take your own photos when you move in, and take departure photos too, otherwise you could lose most of your deposit.","185":null,"186":null,"187":null,"188":"Great value for money, bills included, flexible contract and no deposit.

It was not until we had our first check-in that litany of issues with the apartment became apparent. Most of the light fixtures did not work, the taps were non-functioning, the toilet was blocked, the heating did not work, the fridge and oven were broken, the storage spaces were filled with junk (mostly broken furniture, building materials and old, Urdu-language VHS tapes!), the electricity was on a key-meter and this had not been topped up (meaning the inspection was done in the dark), the locks were broken on the front door, several electricity sockets were non-functioning, even the furniture that was provided was dirty and damaged, but had been cleverly presented in a way that meant this was not obvious until closer inspection. As we had moved down from Manchester to move into this property we had arrived late on a Saturday afternoon and the letting agents, Winkworth New Cross, were finishing for the day by this point. When I called them and told them about all of these issues they were reluctant to do anything until Monday morning and it took a significant amount of arguing to get them to agree to send out an emergency repairman (I believe it was when I pointed out that I would not be able to go to the bathroom that they finally acquiesced). To top it all off, after the first night we awoke completely covered in bed-bug bites! \n\r\nFirst thing on Monday I presented to Winkworth\u2019s office with an extensive list of issues that required fixing. They acted sympathetic and promised to get everything sorted but it took the best part of a month before all of the issues were resolved (at least they agreed to replace the bed and have the place fumigated as soon as possible!)\n\r\nSadly, this experience set the tone for the rest of the tenancy and we experienced various issues throughout our stay. Mould quickly built up around the windows despite them being left open (it did not help that the seals on the double glazing had perished on nearly every single window, thus allowing damp to accumulate in and around them). Winkworth were quick to blame us for this but on closer inspection I found evidence that mould had been present in the property for a while and the previous tenant (or Winkworth) had simply painted over it. The heating system was an electric boiler which, aside from being highly inefficient and expensive, broken down every few weeks \u2013 the landlord refused to replace it and instead had every single part of it replaced using second-had parts (sadly this made for a lot of cold showers in the winter). One month after moving in, the wall-mounted shelves that the landlord had provided fell off the wall, destroying everything that was on or under them. The agents were quick to send the repairman out on this occasion to remove them and fix the holes they had left in the wall and, on inspection, he asserted that these were \u2018not weight-bearing shelves\u2019 as the wall was too soft to support such weight. \n\r\nEventually the landlord tired of having to pay for these various repairs and, cleverly, told the agents that repairs could only be carried out with his permission and then began ignoring their attempts to contact him. \n\r\nThe building itself was an odd, 50\/50 mix of perfectly nice people and anti-social reprobates which meant we were frequently disturbed by loud parties, domestic disputes and the occasional police raid. In fairness, the company managing the property were fairly helpful in dealing with anti-social tenants but as soon as such one group was evicted another would take their place. The neighbourhood was of a similar character and their would often be incidents of petty crime, anti-social behaviour and even gang-fights and fatal stabbings in the immediate vicinity. Indeed, I was once woken up at 4am on a Tuesday by the sound of 6 large men having a melee immediately outside our bedroom window. \n\r\nWhen I finally left the property I had to spend 6 weeks arguing with Winkworth regarding the deposit. It was 14 days before they eventually replied to my enquires \u2013 I pointed out that at this point they were legally obligated to return my deposit without deductions but apparently they were unfamiliar with basic tenancy law. They demanded to know where the aforementioned, non-weight bearing shelves were \u2013 they had no record of them falling down and demanded I pay for them. They demanded to know where all the broken furniture from the storage spaces were \u2013 again, they had no record of agreeing to remove them as they were clearly beyond repair. They then insisted that the property, having now been empty for 3 weeks since I left, had become dusty and needed a full professional clean which I should pay for. Eventually, following the exchange of some very loud words and threats of litigation, they backed down and returned my deposit in full. \n\r\nTo cut a very long story short \u2013 avoid this property and its agents if you can. The amount of rent they charge for a property of this type, in this neighbourhood, is exorbitant and you can get far more for your money (and live in a much nicer area) if you look slightly further away from the city centre.  \n\r\nEdit: Apologies for the formatting, this site doesn\\\\\\'t seem to allow paragraphs.","195":"This was an awful property to live in and the estate agent Annandvilla was a very unhelpful estate agent: \r\n-Both the estate agent and the landlord failed to inform us that a conservatory was to be built off the back of the downstairs bedroom, which started being built at the beginning of our 6 month let, then was left leaving the downstairs bedroom dark. and looking out onto a concrete room.\r\n-There was an infestation on cockroaches from the beginning which still wasn\\'t gone when we left.\r\n-There was a rat on the top floor.\r\n-The toilet was blocked then temporarily fixed then blocked again.\r\n-It was advertised with a dishwasher which never worked.\r\n-The washing machine broke and took 6 weeks to fix, but we were never offered money towards the launderette.\n\r\n-They never gave us half our deposit back due to dirt in the sink and the inside of the oven door not being clean.

Some aspects of the house is new but some are very old like the crevices in the wall, hole in the toilet wall from where the surveyors thought the rodents were entering the house. The rodent menace eventually got so bad that it required deep cleaning every week. Landlady was not cooperative enough as she got the pest control to place only mouse traps, which we already did ourselves. The house needs proper pest control. There were other issues such as very old appliances like fridge (we had to buy our own to survive) , leaking washing machine which we eventually got replaced, main door lock was faulty. Also no exhaust in the bathroom. Worst landlord ever !! Don\\'t rent this property please!","204":"\u2022\tIn an email dated 4.10.15, the landlady said that she would inspect the flat once every 3 months with a week\u2019s notice. Later on, she said that only 24 hours notice was necessary and that it did not have to be at a convenient time for us. She often appeared on a Saturday morning \u2013 the most inconvenient time for those that work 9-5, 5 days a week and want to enjoy their free time. Her inspections increased, at one point, to twice a week for two weeks. We cleaned the flat regularly, but she expected the flat to be absolutely spotless \u2013 i.e. not lived in. For example, she complained several times about dust on top of the doorframes and watermarks in the sink.\n\r\n\u2022\tThe landlady would send her brother, who lived in the building, to the flat to inspect it or if we had a problem that needed fixing. He was incredibly rude and unhelpful and not what we signed up for. On one occasion he let himself into our flat without notice. It made me feel incredibly nervous living there on my own (my housemate was away a lot), knowing that he had a key.\n\r\n\u2022\tIt got to the point that I was scared to be in the flat on my own. My housemate would be away for months at a time for work and I became incredibly anxious living there, knowing that she could come over with only 24hrs notice, and that her brother had a key to the flat. \r\n\u2022\tThe tenancy agreement clearly stated that the landlord\/landlady should not infringe upon the tenants \u2018quiet enjoyment of the flat\u2019 \u2013 she did. \n\r\n\u2022\tOne Saturday, when the landlady came for an inspection, she was particularly aggressive towards me. She did not realise that my boyfriend was in my bedroom and, when he heard how rude she was being towards me, he politely asked her not to speak to me in that way. She immediately put her hand in his face saying \u2018I am not talking to you\u2019 and said that he could never visit the flat again. After this incident, Neda became convinced that we had other people living in the flat. \n\r\n\u2022\tWhen I was in the process of signing for a new flat, I was asked to give the contact details of my current landlord so that they could provide a reference. I asked the landlady\u2019s permission to do this and she asked me to ring her. On the phone, she said that I had been an awful tenant and that, to give me a good reference would be a lie. However, she said that she also wanted me gone from the flat, and so preceded to blackmail me by saying that she would only give me a good reference if I promised to get the flat professionally cleaned after moving out. Since it had been my intention to do this anyway, I agreed. Needless to say, having said that she would give me a reference, she didn\u2019t and ignored all phone calls and emails from Let Alliance when they tried to contact her for one. As a consequence, I had to provide my previous 6 months of bank statements to prove that I had paid my rent on time.\n\n\r\nI paid for the flat to be professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy. The plastic sofa had a slight rip on the seam. The DSA advised me that it was fair wear and tear as you can see where the other seam was ripping. However, the landlady said that we had to pay for a new sofa. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme clearly states that: \u201cLandlords should therefore keep in mind that the tenant\u2019s deposit is not to be used like an insurance policy where you might get \u201cfull replacement value\u201d or \u201cnew for old\u201d.\u201dIn the end she asked for \u00a3150 towards it, which we paid because, by that point we were exhausted by the back and forth arguing. \n\r\nI would be happy to provide further pictures and emails for evidence.","205":null,"206":"(continued from 18 Blawith Road HA1 1TN review)\r\nThis property of the same landlord also has many occupants (10), however tends to be quieter and cleaner.\r\nMy stay here would have been pleasant, if it was not for one of the tenants.

The boiler broke down twice leaving me freezing and unable to shower in the middle of winter that my mother had to drive all the way from London just to provide me with an electric heater (as I am disabled), and there were issues with the electricity and the toilet.\n\r\nI was told by several engineers that visited the property that the tank and water system are ancient and belong in antiquity which is why they had a tendency to break down every few months. A complete overhaul of the tank and water system would be needed but the landlord unwilling to fork out for such a cost, refused to follow their recommendations.\n\r\nRegarding the landlord, she was a very vindictive landlord who took an instant dislike to me because I reported and chased up all the repair issues needed in the flat. She appeared to be content with me living in a flat paying a very high amount of money which she increased after a year without any dispute from me yet I couldn\u2019t use hot water in the kitchen taps. Halfway through the tenancy during a particularly bad repair issue whereby I had no heating for a few days, my mother tried to call and speak to reason with her and she cut the phone on her and refused to engage with me directly since then, only going through the agent.\n\r\nShe made a point at the start of the tenancy to make me take down her number and message her if there were any issues, but when I proceeded to do just that she appeared annoyed and implied that I should only be contacting the estate agency so as not to disturb her. \n\r\nWorse of all, she came every few months to pick up her mail which she failed to redirect, so I had to separate my mail from hers and she would drop by at any time usually only giving me a few hours notice to collect her mail.","220":null,"221":null,"222":"Together Housing are little more than a estate management company with huge profits and little in the way of accountability.

The price was high to start with but we unfortunately had ran out of other options. The landlords became more hostile as the tenancy progressed, as they seemed to be reasonable at first but gradually and by the end of the tenancy seemed to turn unfairly sour and expected unreasonable levels of strict behaviour and cleanliness far above and beyond what the flat was like at the start of the tenancy and we had to fight to get our sizeable deposit back, even with deductions. The paperwork\/process in general was quite disoncerting with little assurance that our payments were actually going where they were meant to. The landlords were pretty rude and unfair about us during and especially after leaving in correspondence. Even though it is advertised as being appropriate for students, any levels of noise or disruption or cleanliness less than completely pristine were not well tolerated so we would not recommend this for students. We also felt misled by the fact that we found it on a large online property website yet never had the option of direct contact or support from that company and instead dealt exclusively with the landlords who had simply used that website to advertise their property and discouraged us from contacting them.\r\nLogistically, it is quite an anti-social property as there are no shared communal areas and flats are far apart so we never really met or socialised with the other residents and it was pretty lonely. No parking was available so moving in and out was a bit of a nightmare, relying on carrying items from random car park spaces in the nearest local park. Since then we have had much more comfortable experiences dealing with professional estate agents and would always recommend that you go for those instead of these landlords who are not professional and have unreasonable expectations on tenants.\r\nFurniture generally was not in good condition and was either strangely pieced together or unusable for the bed, some tables and chairs which were sticky. The flies were a huge problem, flying in and out of the flat in swarms and whilst this was not exclusively the fault of the landlords as they seemed to fly in and out as they pleased if the windows were open (which they had to be as the flat got very hot at all times of year) some warning\/assistance would have helped as bug bites were all too frequent. The lighting was naturally pretty dim when you were far away from the windows. The oven was not in a nice condition to start with (untreatably dirty) and the bathroom lacking in wallpaper\/mould prevention on the walls\/ceiling\/bath\/other surfaces.\r\nThey also somehow did not seem to know how the electricity worked (there is no gas) so we had to find that out all by ourselves and were without electricity for a few days while we had to contact and liaise with the electricity company. There are definitely many better options at much cheaper prices. The advertised rent was actually less than we had to pay in reality as the landlords advertised rent was every 28 days without bills so actual monthly costs (every 30\/31 days) were considerably higher. We would absolutely recommend people look elsewhere at professional estate agents\\' properties. Also, general advice: take photos of all furniture in your rented property wherever you go when you move in so you can use those as evidence to them if needed (this would have made getting our deposit back slightly easier\/possible when they accused us of leaving the apartment in a decrepid state which was frankly ridiculous as we cleaned it to a considerably better state than we found it in and a very reasonable state to the same standard as professional cleaners).","238":null,"239":"Be careful while signing the tenancy agreement.They have 2 months notice period on agreement.They are not bothered about tenants health and safety .","240":"Whenever there was an issue with the flat, the response from the landlord was essentially if you have a problem, move out.

We stopped calling because there was no point.  At the time the flat was incredibly affordable so we stayed, but we were glad to go when we did.  Proceed with caution.","241":"Have nothing to say , juat an simple property with an nice landlord","242":"I had a very bad experience as a tenant at this property, which was a managed letting (via Douglas & Simmons, Wantage). It should be noted that the property is quite old, dating back to the 17th century.\n\r\nThe owners, at the time of my letting, with the help of the letting agency, disputed my deposit (of five weeks rent), made false and grossly inaccurate claims to the Deposit Protection Scheme (DPS), including unofficial claims not listed in their offiical submission to the DPS. In fact, the total of the owners\\' claims on the deposit exceeded the deposit by about \u00a330. The DPS, after considering the matter for almost 6 weeks, rejected their claims, and noted that it was their obligation to prove their claims, and not the tenant\\'s to disprove theirs, and that the owners had not proved their claims. The DPS also rebuked the owners and the letting agency for including unofficial claims on the deposit.\n\r\nThe main claim by the owner related to damage to the plaster on the living room ceiling caused by water leaking from a standing bath upstairs. This happened within months of moving in, and was immediately reported by me to the letting agents. The letting agency did nothing for five months, and then sent a local contractor who was also unable to do anything. Clearly, there was a pre-existing defect in the bath, or the tiling, that allowed water to leak through the ceiling. It was not fit for purpose, and the owners should have realised this, before letting the property. \n\r\nThe unofficial claims on the deposit included spurious claims for \\\"gardening costs\\\", despite being presented with very recent invoices for garden trimming jobs by a local private contractor, and also a charge to re-attach the owner\\'s dishwasher in place of my washing machine, something which I have never been asked to do in any previous letting.\n\r\nThe owners were ultimately responsible for responding to maintenance issues, but this was generally quite unsatisfactory.\n\r\nThe property may have changed hands, but if you are a tenant here, be aware of the bath, the garden, and the fact that house is more than three centuries old.","243":"whole property was trashed, missing carpets. paint stains on remaining carpets. leaking plumbing, broken front and back doors. kitchen was falling to pieces. mould in bathroom and under kitchen sink. \r\nmade to live with unsafe boiler - no heating or hot water for 13 months!! \r\nenvironmental health involved but landlord lives in Vietnam so nothing they could do.\r\nLandlord does nothing but lie and avoid situations, used the excuse of being in and out of prison in Vietnam to avoid replacing illegal boiler.

The most prolific would have been the heavy mould issue in the bathroom ceiling and on several walls including the kitchen. There were some major plumbing issues and regular blockage of the drains. Eventually after much persistence we had a wall repaired and the house was painted, some furniture was also replaced. Whilst I would say that the agents were always polite, they were a bit slow to respond to the requests, often the excuse being they did not receive the email or could not recall meeting with us. The property is in a good location as a commuter to the city you would benefit a lot from the tube station within walking distance. Our bedroom was on the first floor and whilst the street are relatively quiet, there were a few occasions where people would stand outside and converse quite loudly. I spotted a few mice at the property but their sightings usually coincided with blocked drains and heavy rains. The garden is relatively low maintenance as it is paved but there is an issue with mouldy growths from excessive moisture in parts. The property is dark inside, on the ground floor you need the lights on in the day. There is a reception room on the ground floor which was used as a bedroom but the house is clearly a 3 bed with all the bedrooms on the first floor. As a multiple let for strangers, it is over crowded as there is only one small bathroom. As a let for a family, its a good size. The kitchen and bathroom needs serious attention. The walls have cracks and moisture. The single  bedroom upstairs is almost uninhabitable as it is freezing, and mould ridden. We cleaned it and repainted twice out of our own pockets. The guttering needs attention as it is allowing moisture to go into the walls. Damp re-proofing much needed. The inner staircase is broken and has been repaired by us, but not officially by a builder from the agency (the issue was brought up but not attended to).

We had to wait a few weeks to get the roofers in to fix the gutters and block the hole. Also there was a huge safety risk with the windows. Located at the front of the property, they could not be locked and the main large window could be pushed from the outside in so anyone could come in and leave the property easily with large items.

I don\\'t want to see them again! Awful people.","282":"The light fitting in our bathroom, an internal room with no windows, broke very early into our tenancy, and was not fixed for over a month. We had to use torches to use the bathroom. This should have been a warning to us for the issues we would have with maintenance. The property is managed through a local estate agent branch. We ended up having to get in contact with the head office and leave several complaints in order to get any maintenance work done. The staff at the local office were rude and completely incompetent through the whole process.. We were not given any details about our landlord and had to get his sister\u2019s number (they both rent out flats in the building) from our neighbour in order to try and sort the maintenance issues. We also had the heating element in our oven break, which again took far longer to fix than it should have. We were told our tenancy would be continued after the initial six months, they said they were waiting for the landlord to sign the paperwork. He instead sent a staff member from the estate agents late one evening to serve us our notice and refused to give a reason as to why. When we moved out, we made sure to clean the entire property thoroughly. If anything it was in a better condition than when we moved in, but we made the error of not taking photographic evidence. The landlord refused to give us back our full deposit, stating that the flat required \u201cprofessional cleaning\u201d, which was completely untrue and unfair. We were always good tenants, we paid our rent on time, looked after the flat and didn\u2019t cause any problems. We would not recommend this property to anyone, and will never rent through this estate agents again, and would encourage people to stay away from them (they still rent out this property now).","283":null,"284":"Managing agents always drag their heels to pass on issues but if we miss an appointment they charge \u00a370.

The whole basement flat has in total two windows on the lower ground floor and two smaller windows in the other room on the ground floor, hence it\\'s dark and depressing most of the time and there is a huge problem with humidity and condensation. There are no windows in the two bathrooms neither in kitchen and one bedroom, which is really a storage room. The flat was flooded during our tenancy and the damage was so severe that we had to move out and terminate our tenancy. The landlady was difficult to reach when we had problems and never fixed them, despite taking the money from the deposit paid.

I cleaned it with mould remover, and even ordered in hospital-grade cleaner, which did nothing. Within days the mould was back and worse than ever.\n\r\nSecondly, every window in this three bedroom flat leaked. The master bedroom window leaked so bad, there were pools of water on the sill after every rain. The other windows in the house would seep in water, too.\n\r\nThirdly, the electrics were an utter shambles. Plug sockets were hanging off the walls, half of them didn\\'t work, and there was cabling running next to the bath and toilet waste pipes.\r\nWhere they had installed mains wired fire alarms, they had moved the light fitting and left a hole with dangling wires.\n\r\nDespite informing the Estate Agents if these issues, nothing was ever done.

The property was not managed by an agency just rented through it. They made no effort to fix the issues. The issues are as follows:\n\r\n- The house is not appropriately insulated and allows for ALL the heat to escape, despite multiple beggings for them to fix it we were forced to live in a freezing house. \r\n- They pretend there are radiators when in fact there are storage heaters which is not the same.\r\n- Overnight heating on boiler not working despite claims from landlord to repair it\r\n- Overnight temperature downstairs is 14 degrees; enough to wake up like an icicle.\r\n-  The landlord makes promises and never delivers and what is worse thinks it\\'s funny that the shower hardly has any water coming out of it. \r\n- The house needed a thorough renovation 50 years ago, and much more now.\r\n- They managed to install some foam upstairs to insulate the house marginally. \r\n- The bathroom window has a permanent ventilation hole with no radiator so again, deep freeze.\r\n- The flooring and the wood is poor, there is no space and the living room has been transformed into a double room.\r\n- furnished property that came with broken chairs that did not match - sat down and fell. if that was my father he\\'d be dead now. \r\n- the shower hardly works and the landlord claims he will repair but doesnt.\n\r\nThe landlord doesn\\'t care about the property and the agency didn\\'t care either.\n\r\nRented to students who were treated like cattle.

I think the house itself needs major renovation. There are two receptions which are very small and not appropriate for a young bustling family. We had difficulty inviting anybody over as there was barely any space for an extra person or two sit down in the small reception. The property itself had not been extended at the rear unlike pretty much every property on the street, making the living area extremely cramped. This is particularly relevant given the high market equivalent rents we were paying (we would have paid similar or lower rents for extended, renovated properties). The carpets are very worn and clearly need replacing. The only reason we moved in the first place was because of an emergency situation involving another property, where we risked being stranded as a young family, so we took the first property that we could move in at the earliest. Our younger child was born after we moved in and this made it difficult for us to move out immediately.\n\r\nFurther, we had a very difficult experience dealing with both the landlord as well as estate agents. The landlord was described by the agent himself as being \\'pernickety\\' and that I think describes the behavior best. Minor issues were raised towards the end of our tenancy for which we were charged anywhere from 5-200 pounds. We got the strong feeling of being taken advantage of and a guise of renovating several things in the house which are bound to be impacted by wear and tear (Especially with a family with two young kids). It needs to remembered that we had lived in this house for three years, never had any delayed rents, never haggled about anything much. I think, in all fairness, we were very good tenants and behaved how we would like to be treated if we were on the other side. \n\r\nI think landlords should appreciate the difference between intentional damage to the property vs accidental damage vs wear and tear that is natural over time. The first two should be repaired by tenants, the last should be resolved amicably. Many of the complaints against us fit the last description and I knew if I raised this to arbitration, it would be resolved in our favour. Further, I think landlords like this one need to recognise the common sense logic of renting to trustworthy people who will take care of their property and look at the bigger picture. Its a small world and in today\\'s connected world, getting a bad reputation wont help.","303":null,"304":"This is for a room in Flat 5. I was subletting so cannot comment on the price of any additional bills such as electricity, internet, etc. but I was happy to pay the price that I did for the size of the room. I also cannot comment on any interaction with the landlord. Large bathroom with a good shower, but quite a small kitchen; no more than two people would want to be in it at once. The room was north-facing, so didn\\'t get a lot of light, but meant that it was away from the noise of the street. Building work on the restaurant next door, however, went on for months starting at roughly 7.30 a.m. each morning. Bicycles could be stored in the halls although not explicitly allowed. Since the building is located in the center of Brighton, it was very convenient. Fairly erratic neighbours downstairs, however, who could frequently be heard yelling at each other, banging on doors, etc.","305":"Nice looking, clean good sized apartment overall. Really close to the town centre which is a huge plus.\n\r\nOur property was managed by the estate agent Venture Properties who were overall very organised and helpful. When we moved in there was a leak under the sink for which they quickly arranged for a plumber to fix. They could have done more to pressure the plumber to fix the problem and chosen a more reliable company, as the one they chose took more than a week to come out leaving us without water for a week. \n\r\nHouse was very clean on moving in and was easy to keep clean. Very efficient heating meant energy bills were low and the house heats up to room temperature naturally spring to autumn. North and east facing windows meant that we only got sun in the morning and this combined with a lack of any outdoor space made us feel cramped at times.\n\r\nNoise: Next to a busy road but you can\u2019t hear it when the windows are closed.

Somewhat tatty and not been refurbished for a long time with old, stained carpets and curtains, cracked paint etc. The more important issues with this property stem from the landlady (Deborah Turner) and the way in which the property was managed. The landlady lives overseas and wants little to do with the property - she appeared for a couple of hours on check in and check out. Serious issues such as a faulty gas fireplace (unsafe) were either not fixed satisfactorily, took huge amounts of correspondence and pushing or were not fixed.\n\r\nThe major issue here though is the financial management. We were able to meet the previous tenants in order to give them some mail that had arrived, they had moved locally. They said we should be very careful with the deposit when checking out, we listened but were not sure exactly what the problem was. They did say they were having to fight to get their deposit back. When we left at the end of the tenancy having looked after the property well and left it in better condition than when when we moved in, we then understood what the previous tenants meant.\n\r\nThe landlady did an inspection (before we moved out but when we were not there so could not comment on her observations) and sent a list of issues she wanted to keep money for. This was for most of the \u00a34,500 deposit. We were shocked! We replied with detailed answers to her points however she just did not respond to what she said and continued to press for money. Fortunately we had taken photographs of all issues\/marks in the house the day after we moved in - these had been emailed to the landlady at the time, and also when she raised issues upon checkout. We provide detailed explanations on each problem she wanted us to pay for, sent copies of emails with her from during he tenancy, and resent t photographs. However when repkying she chose to ignore our explanations and not respond the points made, to ignore th  photographic evidence and ignore the copies of email correspondence! For example, she wanted money for a wooden island top to be resanded - we even had a photo of the poor condition it was in when we moved in. Landlady said it had been newly sanded and varnished before we moved in - nonsense. She wanted us to pay for an aerial on the roof to be repaired - we had not even had terrestrial TV. Many other items also. It became clear she was just out to get as much money from our deposit as possible and not to consider the evidence supplied. This was very frustrating. Her communication became aggressive and inappropriately unprofessional.\n\r\nThis had to go through the dispute process with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme - we raised a case. It takes a lot of time to be thorough in contesting the landlady\\'s dishonesty point by point but the photos and email evidence we had kept every time we communicated with her meant the outcome was we were asked to pay less than \u00a3200 from the deposit instead of the \u00a34,000 she wanted. Fortunately the TDS is there to stop dishonest landlords from stealing from tenants and we were protected as a result. I would strongly recommend not renting this property as it seems the landlady tries it on at the end of all tenancies to steal money from tenants\\' deposits as they leave (as evidenced by the tenants before us, and us). It\\'s sad people like this are still allowed to rent out properties and try to take advantage of people. Fortunately we were prepared so she didn\\'t get away with it. Avoid.

If you try to reason with him, he will do whatever is possible to kick you out of his property. I had him knocking on my door at 10:00 o\\'clock at night collecting the rent which was meant to be paid the next day. The property is set up as a \\\"make do\\\" condition, everything has been unprofessionally repaired, the washing machine kept breaking down which left us without anything to clean our clothes for a week every time. In the end, the landlord bought another second hand washing machine. All the furniture in the property was found from outside, including the beds and mattresses. \n\r\nAll in all I would not recommend this property to anyone. You can find something much better for the price and you would be able to relax in your rented property without having someone knocking on your door almost every day.","361":null,"362":"The landlord was very slow to respond to any issues and in the main did not make any remedial work. For example broken drawers, broken slats under the bed, windows painted shut (fire hazard) were never fixed and therefore  we had to resolve these ourselves. \r\nDamp and peeling paint in the bathroom  was not dealt with till a year after we reported it and only when we had given notice that we were leaving. Boiler broke and needed replacing, the landlord did not give the go ahead for it to be replaced for a month after receiving the quotes and only when we were in our last two weeks of being in the flat.\r\nAlso the furniture in the flat was old or broken, eg sofa , living room rug, vacuum cleaner, kitchen bin. The sofa was very uncomfortable and the land lord would not replace it or allow us to. The rug was quite worn and again the landlord would not replace it or allow us to. The bin and the vacuum were broken and we were not allowed to dispose of them as the landlord wants to keep them for the next tenant.\r\nThe neighbours were nice but could be noisy, they occasionally had friends over in the garden till early hours in the morning and because the bedroom backs on to the garden and was not double glazed the noise when it happened was very intrusive.\r\nThere is a very popular pub across the road from the flat and when not in COVID times was open till early hours in the morning on the weekend and therefore noise was quite loud at the front of the flat. However the pub did try hard  in trying to keep people quiet and move them on when they left the pub.\r\nThe flat is in a great location and had some nice features, the kitchen was okay and there is a lot of storage space and the garden is very big and spacious if quite shade, but for the amount of money we paid I would have expected the landlord to be slightly attentive.","363":null,"364":"Lovely house in a lovely area.\n\r\nI really enjoyed my stay at this house the area is perfect and the house is a lovely house with great housemates.\n\r\nThe landlord Alex was always there if we had any issues and any problems at the house were sorted straight away.","365":"If there is an issue with the property the landlord is not flexible to fix the issue at all.","366":null,"367":null,"368":null,"369":null,"370":null,"371":"Landlord wont do repairs everytime I asked was always asked did I want my deposit back place is disgusting over run with mice was told by landlord it was up to me to clear mice the property is full of mould an the entire building is a health issue","372":"We have left the property 17 days ago and although the property has been left much cleaner and with a much better maintained garden; we are still waiting for our deposit to be returned. The landlord wants to claim 2 missing bulbs whereas those were already missing at the check in time, when we arrived. It is really clearly mentioned in the inventory. Now they want to claim for a bit of paint chipped off from the window sill and we are still waiting to know how much money they want to take from our deposit. It is just ridiculous, especially when we had been really good tenants, paying our rents always on time and having taken good care of this house.\r\nIt was a mistake renting this house.","373":"We lived in the property for 15 months. During this period we noticed:\n\r\n1) noise from upstairs and common entrance: it is possible to hear everyone going in and out of the property clearly. The hallway door doesn\u2019t close gently so all tenants have to push it to close which you can hear loud and clear from both bedrooms. Also above the main bedroom is the first floor living room and kitchen so whenever you go to bed you can still hear the neighbor above you walking, watching tv and cooking. You can also hear people going up and down the hallway stairs clearly from any of the bedrooms.\n\r\n2) pigeons: the pateo on the second bedroom was inaccessible for 4 months. Pigeons nested in the property and were using the pateo and the pipes to poop. Spikes were installed and no poop has been found since.\n\r\n3) Mice: two different surveyors attested the property has mice access points in the kitchen. The issue was reported on May 29th 2020 and hasn\u2019t been fixed yet . I am writing this on June 28th 2020.\n\r\n4) Rat in the front garden: rubbish bins do not have lids and the front garden was maintained once in 15 months .

If you move in you will need to provide your own blinds, the ones from the landlord in the bedrooms are paper thin, you will wake up at dawn and he refuses to replace them.  When we moved in there was a prepayment meter we were not informed of, the landlord misled us to say Southwark Council don\\'t allow them to be changed (I called the council up and confirmed this was incorrect).  The property managers are not helpful, at the end of our tenancy they ignored our requests (emails and phone calls) for the check out report for a month.\r\nOverall it is a nice flat but given its location, exterior, other flats available for a similar price and lack of outdoor space it is overpriced.","379":"The landlord was nice enough to give us our deposit, however Leoneard Lease\\'s attempt to take our deposit was brutal and unfair.

My flat was the perfect size for me as a student\/young professional, a large kitchen-lounge, a decent sized bedroom and bathroom. Furniture was provided by the landlord and was good quality. In the winter the property was quite cold probably due to it being an old building, the flat had electric heating which meant in the coldest months was a bit expensive to heat the flat.\r\nLandlords: Virginia and David Gatherer\r\nVirginia and David were the best landlords I\\'ve ever had. The move in process was very smooth and the flat was perfectly clean, Virginia even offers help with setting up your bills which was very helpful for me as this was my first time renting after living in student halls. I saw them both on a regular basis as they owned a lot of properties in the street so were around a lot doing odd jobs. They were fantastic with any repairs that needed doing, getting them done quickly and were also very helpful by being there when any workmen\/plumbers etc were coming and I couldn\\'t be in due to being at work. Every week David would put the communal bins out for collection so none of the tenants had to worry about this. The property had high ceilings so they even changed the lightbulbs for me when needed. Virginia\\'s communication with us was fantastic, always informing us if there were to be any workmen around the properties, if she would be showing people around etc. Overall Virginia and David were great landlords, as someone that moved to Sunderland from out of the area on my own I felt very lucky to have them as my landlords and felt I could ask them for any assistance I needed.\r\nArea:\r\nor me the property was the perfect location. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the University of Sunderland city campus which is where I was based as a student. It also less than 15 minutes walk from Sunderland Hospital which was perfect for me as this where I worked during and after my degree. There is a metro station at the end of the street, less than 2 minutes walk, providing easy access to Newcastle. The city centre is about 15 minutes walk away. There is an aldi about 20 minutes walk away, a morrisons petrol station around the corner and also a small corner shop less than a minute away. As a student or young professional working in the city centre this would be the perfect location for you to live. The property is quite close to a main road which could be slightly noisy at busy times.","387":"1. Kitchen sink block. It will remain an issue forward though we as tenants, hired an engineer to fix it three times along. I did so because landlord responses slower than she should and sent nasty, rude, unprofessional men to fix it poorly. And landlord has not paid back to me yet. More importantly, it will still be an issue as the kitchen pipe was set up in a wrong way, so that new drainage will keep blocking the sink, according to expert advice I seek, unless landlord will pay to re-install the sink pipe properly, which is highly unlikely as I observe. \n\r\n2. Condensation or mould issues. The main bedroom has a gas pipe built INSIDE it, again in a wrong and stupid way. Water condensates on the pipe and no carbon monoxide indicator is installed. The main bedroom is thus very damp in winter. This is against the law severely. The bath room is slightly better but the fan is too weak to help. We had to open windows each time after showering in whatever weather. \n\r\n3. The carpets in two rooms are quite old and it takes a lot of efforts to clean them. \n\r\n3. Mice were found in 2015 winter. Though we purchased poison to kill them, mice feces are still identified in the kitchen as recent as Dec\/2016. \n\r\n4. Induction process by landlord and estate agent. It was done poorly or more precisely, it was not done at all. Agent leaded me into the flat and when I challenged him that it was not properly cleaned, he boldly said I need to clean it myself. Landlady did not appear at all on the first I moved in, and snobbishly left an inventory without any photo taken. Also the inventory contained wrong readings of meters. Be careful about that! \n\r\n5. Landlord\/Managing agents. A simple word for Landlord and Landlady: horrible. They are ignorant, and rude. But landlady carries an additional feature: smarmy. As to agents, I met several of them. They are generally sneaky, coward. I say so because they appear harsh but become soft when I challenge them with the law. \n\r\n6. Deposit refund. Landlady claims to charge me for \\'professional cleaning\\', though the flat was not professionally cleaned when I moved in. I am still working to request for my deposit back. \n\r\n7. Therefore stay away from this property and its landlord\/landlady including its agent Foxton.","388":"The agency and landlord for this property is to be avoided. Not only did they lie and deceive me into believing this flat was in a good condition, they charged me a higher rental than what it\\'s been put back on the market for after my complaints on the first move in date. I found over a dozen Marriott inhabitable issues from damp and mould, to broken fridge and freezer compartments, to broken furniture and wall damages. All of which were hidden from me and the landlord didn\\'t even think to fix these issues until I complained that I would not move in until these got fixed. Despite some issues being fixed, the leaking water tap on the bathroom continued to be an issue, wall paint was patchy, white goods were still broken and I was lied to think a professional cleaning service had been here before I attempted to move in. \n\r\nIn the end I refused to sign the tenancy and did not move in as I found the property nothing like it\\'s advertised, and this is entirely down to both the agent (Lia) and landlord being deceitful and untrustworthy.\n\r\nA property to be avoided at all cost.

I asked if it was bad and they nodded.\r\nNot long later, the landlord explained he could not afford the house and he had to sell up, he gave me 6 months to leave. \r\nAs i was looking for alternative accommodation i come across the house listed up for higher price. He lied so that he could get someone new in that wasn\\'t aware of the bad mould and damp and chimney breast at risk of falling. And to get more money. \r\nI would stay clear of this landlord. His property is still up for let now as he can not seem to keep people there as he is charging so much rent and he has had to now drop it back down. \r\nIt makes me angry that landlords can just get you to leave for their own greed. \r\nHe would often ask for rent to be paid in cash and he would also use the house for his own storage (shed and loft) which was very inconvenient.","393":"Landlord is very reasonable, If you work with them they will work with you -- Don\\'t mess them around, be upfront and explain what you want and where you\\'re coming from; and they\\'ll try to accommodate you as much as possible.","394":"Since moving in I have had issues with 1 neighbour, who has tried to kill me twice.

At the end of the month we have to vacate the property and live on the streets!","395":"Everything is being repaired extremely slow. Currently we have no hot water and no heating for three weeks, and we have a 10 months old baby. We did previously have an issue with the boiler which lasted for three months (it turned off during the night, and that was winter months)\r\nBecause of this we started to have mould in our apartment which hadn\u2019t been fixed in four months.\r\nThere were other multiple issues including broken furniture and washing machine, no light in one of the bedrooms upon our moving in, etc.","396":"Was not the greatest experience. However the place is liveable but if you are picky or have problems with little issues then probably increase your budget and go somewhere else.","397":"Some things are fine but there have been problems from the beginning that haven\\'t been resolved yet--things that we were told repeatedly (and in writing!) that would be resolved prior to moving in. The biggest problem right now: the shower has never worked and there\\'s no attempt to fix it properly. The shower head has been replaced but it was never broken so it\\'s a useless gesture to make it look like they\\'re fixing things but clearly are not.","398":"We have experienced antisocial behaviour throughout the year. There has been shouting and disruption from above and below, particularly late at night and in the early hours and we have felt unsafe. The flat is very cold in the winter due to a lack of insulation and does not receive much sunlight. Whilst the flat is in fairly good repair for a rental property, I would strongly dissuade anyone from living here!","399":null,"400":"Overall a nice flat to live in.  Cold.  Noisy from upstairs. Great bedroom view. Cool Building.  Bare-bones letting agent who ignores you.  Great location in town.\n\n\r\nThe walls are fairly dented\/scratched, you can tell there hasn\\'t been any redecorating in a fairly long time.  There\\'s especially a huge hole in one door . (a couple inches tall) which they were asked to but never did fix.\n\r\nYou can hear upstairs talking and their footsteps, but not any of the other neighbours.  No-one played loud music whilst we were there.  The bedroom side is quiet, although my partner could hear when busses go past (I couldn\\'t).  You can hear a small amount of general road noise from the lounge side.\n\r\nThere is a large building opposite the road (lounge side) which is due for demolition - it\\'s been waiting to come down for 8 months, unsure when that will start.\n\r\nThe heating is very old night storage, and is not really worth using.  It heats up with cheaper electricity overnight, and then slowly releases heat throughout the day.  Heating has a mode designed to release heat slower early in the day so you still have heating in the evening, but during winter most of the heat dissapates by mid-afternoon despite this (they are very old units).  Turning up the heating to full input does get the winter temperature above 16 for most of the day, so it\\'s not illegal, but was impractically expensive to run.  Was without heating for a month waiting for the landlord\/agency to fix.  1 week of this was fair as plumbers were waiting for parts, but the other 3 weeks was the landlord\/letting agency being slow.\n\r\nNo pets were allowed, no photos were allowed to be hung.   Several requests for minor repairs (a loose\/wobbly tap, a hole in a door etc..) were ignored.  Charged \u00a360 for end of tenancy cleaning despite in our opinion it being cleaner than we received the flat.  Talk lots of your own photos when you move in.\n\r\nWas told on viewing (not in contract) that there are communal cupboards in the hallway, but this was untrue (well they\\'re communal, but not for flat 3).\n\r\nDangerously close to Waitrose.

The door bell is switched off as the silent tenants don\\'t want any disturbance so you can miss recorded delivery mail. The silent tenants keep the house neat and tidy. The floor boards and furniture are really old and the wood has disintegrated. The kitchen is very good. The chair with the broken leg was never replaced. There was damp and condensation in my bedroom. Tiny mice roam around the house from under the carpet due to the very old floor boards. The garden is a dump yard.","405":"Couldn\\'t have asked for a nicer landlord or property.  The flat is bright during the day and cosy at night.  The one issue was when the boiler broke but considering that the property was purchased 3 weeks before I moved in there was no way the landlord could have done anything to prevent it breaking and in the event did everything humanly possible to get it fixed quickly.  Compared to other properties in the area the rent is incredibly reasonable; anything else at this price is either the size of a shoebox or has a really odd layout.  The area is also really nice.  I\\'m sorry to be leaving (moving overseas).","406":null,"407":"This is a lovely little flat which is really well located for Honor Oak, Forest Hill, and the surrounding area. For the rent and the studio flat description you get a good amount of space for one person and in the end my partner moved in as well which just about worked! The private woodland behind is a great addition to the property as well. The main two issues were the damp - when we left we found the back of the sofa to be covered with mould and the bathroom was incredibly damp and needed a dehumidifier running it in constantly. I know this is often a problem with basement flats but after we moved out the landlady appeared to be painting over the mould with damp proofing where as what it really needed was better ventilation. The other issue was the boiler, which may well have been updated by now, but it was faulty and even a professional plumber who came round to check it couldn\\'t get it to run at any less than 100% so to avoid baking alive in there we had to switch it off for most of the time. This affected my gas bill, which took a rather long time to pay off. Other plumbing issues were quickly sorted though and overall the landlady was a great person to deal with.","408":null,"409":"While the property has been recently renovated and looks very good (the bathroom was the selling point but later became the problem child) We slowly realized whoever green-lit the renovation exchanged functionality and quality for aesthetic. On our first day on the property, I noticed a severe mold\/ damp issue, rat or rodent droppings, and missing pieces around the house. None of these issues were made known to us before we decided to rent. I reported said issues the same day, no reply from our property managers. The rodent infestation was the worst. Rats would chew their way through floors and walls, (I don\\'t know if it was the previous tenant or the landlord that decided the best way to combat the problem was to stuff tin foil in the holes.) and leave urine and droppings in the kitchen, we could hear them in the walls. We got nowhere with our estate agents and in the end had to call our own pest control and pay out of pocket, for our first week in the house! Over the next 8 or so weeks, we emailed and called relentlessly about our serious mold issue in my bedroom! It got to a point I had to sleep in the living room as my breathing was getting poor, nausea, headaches, etc not to mention the silverfish and other insects that now infested my room due to the humid environment. In the end, I could no longer wait for our estate agents and had to clean it myself. The room was so damp the paint peeled off all the way down to plaster, on 2 of my walls. I found 3 large black mold clusters, from which more mold and dampness were spreading. I took 2 months of our own work and money just to make the property livable. The dampness and mold is still an ongoing problem. Are estate agents no help at all. They have terrible communication, and customer service, and honestly lost all my trust that they can help us with any of our problems. For example, the plumbing in our bathroom is shot to hell and creates a recurring blockage, and leaks from our toilet. The longer we spend time in the house the more issue we discover. This house is held together by ducktape and paper. I would not be surprised if they used ramen noodles to fix holes in the walls. Overall this house is old, humid, and moldy, with poor ventilation, poor or no insulation, noise pollution from our next-door or upstairs neighbors, and a terrible experience with our estate agents.","410":"OK if you are tight for money and have a low tolerance to mould and noise. \r\nMould is a major headache.

Black mould on furniture, bath, walls and curtains. \r\nSky rocket energy prices - no gas supply and old 60s style heaters that conserve the heat at night and release at day time. This basically means you are throwing money away if you work during the day.IIf you want fast heat up - be ready for stink from the burning dust bits inside the heaters \r\nVery thin walls - you can hear neighbours mobiles and alarm clocks going off pretty well.This creates quite an uncomfortable experience when you have a big family living upstairs. \r\nThe neighbourhood has got from bad to worse - garbabe area is used as a dump for a furniture and house commitee desperately sends out leaflets asking to stop doing it - afaik this did not help.

Our boiler stopped working during the coldest days of the winter and they couldn\u2019t get someone to come in and fix it for 5 days. We had to stay at a nearby motel because we had no heat or hot water. The landlord refused to give us back rent for those days, even though there is a law that states these issues must be fixed within 24 hours. Furthermore, it\u2019s been 3 months since we\u2019ve moved out and he is trying to charge us the majority of the security deposit for extra cleaning, lightbulbs and paint. We only lived there for 6 months. We did not damage the walls any more than they were already damaged. We also replaced all of the lightbulbs that had been working when we arrived. The landlord and letting agents could not care less about the tenants in this flat.","412":null,"413":"Ground floor had slugs and other issues in the wall that the downstairs tenant had to deal with instead. Electricity supply meter is in an inaccessible location of the property to all but the ground floor tenant - begged for both SWALEC (the chosen supplier that charges extortionate prices for \\'economy 7\\' rates that were very difficult to rectify and nearly made me insolvent) and the landlord whom we never saw and that issues the Letting Agency claimed it wasn\\'t their responsibility and would not give the details of the landlord to rectify any major maintainance issues. Heating did not include combi-boiler facilities. Begged to have shower facilities and double glazing fitted, which then without warning made the bill hiked up beyond \\'affordable\\' maximum budget, especially for DSS tenants. Insulation is  appauling and damn was rife unless heating was switched on that caused so many problems with huge energy bills. No effort on the part of the letting agency was made to rectify problems in a timely or polite manner - it always was out of the hands of tenants, even problems with noise nuisance and lack of access to the back garden from upstairs. The whole building is a risk in a fire emergency and no real enforcement by the letting agency to make the property safer or nicer to live in unless the tenant pays extortionate rates for this or is willing to be kicked out at a moments notice for pointing out very basic maintainance issues. Even the electricity circuit breaker was not properly checked to ensure it could stand the small amounts of energy used on other circuits which had to be replaced later by an electrician.

Apparently this was due to some dodgy electrical work done in the past. The landlord never provided an electrical safety certificate. He was very reluctant to spend money solving this (or any other) problem. At the end of the tenancy he tried to extract huge amounts from the deposit and we had to fight very hard to get it back, even though he was asking for money to replace items that had not even been there at the start of the tenancy.

Also, the tenant is the one who pays for the electric on the gate as it is metered in the house. On top of this, at 5am EVERY morning including Sundays, the paper van comes through it, waking everyone up on the clock, to deliver the big house\\'s newspapers. \r\nWhen you are out in the garden there is no privacy, the landlords are constantly out there on their ride on mower, and it is just never peaceful or relaxing, even though it looks it from the outside.

The landlords have completely skimped and left most of it as an 80s house and don\\'t care about their tenants staying long term, they are just greedy, and beware, the landlord neighbour is also an ex-judge and both the husband and wife are extremely condescending. Forget about ever getting fibre broadband. Even though it\\'s next to a housing estate in Bovey it is 2.5 miles from the exchange and on a copper wire and very very slow so no netflix and no gaming for your kids.

There arte no gas services in the property, and the landlord supplies the electricity, and does not allow freestanding gas units or the like, making you beholden to his rates. The front of the property is dominated by the remains of the woodworking factory, and the front is always crowded with work vehicles and blocked walkways, with no way for emergency services if they were needed. The property is not insulated and has a chroinic damp problem, is impossible to heat.

They had no emergency contact number and instead requested emails to be used. As an ISP worker I can list numerous reasons why this is a terrible idea. The issues with leaks were only looked to be fixed after we\u2019d finally had enough and given our notice, the letting agent manager played dumb in terms of us wanting to leave.

However, the managing process by the landlord and repairs have been aweful, making my year there extremely stressful. First, they rented us the property with several problems to the bathroom (no tiling, a leak) that took six weeks to get fixed - without any rent reduction. Second, the people that our landlord sent us to repair problems, did not clean up after themselves and were often late, causing us organisational problems. The electricity had several issues: sometimes it totally stopped working as the circuit is old and got wet. There was mould in one of the rooms, as it had an open flat above. Therefore it is useful to use a dehumidifier. Furthermore, it took them a month to give us our deposit back, which is a very long time. Furthermore, the agency managing the property after we had our deposit back asked us to pay extra fees for cleaning, very dodgy!","472":null,"473":"This property is managed by Hobdays Estate Agency. They are extremely slow to respond to any issue and for the 3 years of our tenancy, we had to constantly chase them - including for issues regarding heating and hot water. They often behave in ways that are essentially unlawful, i.e. they did not fix heating and hot water issues within the timeframe stated by law. We did not have enough hot water for more than a year, due to their (and the landlady\\'s) refusal to replace a non working water tank. The boiler had to be on for 5 hours in order to heat up an extremely old water talk with capacity for two 10-minute showers. \n\r\nWe did not have heating that worked at a good enough standard for two years. The boiler in the property is extremely inefficient due to its age, but the landlords refuse to replace it even though the gas engineer has recommended replacing it every year since 2019. In addition, the property is extremely poorly insulated, which results in a very cold house even with the heating on. \n\r\nFurthermore, it took them 6 days to replace a broken fridge and an entire month to find a tree surgeon to reduce a long branch of a tree that literally only took 5 minutes in the end. Hobdays inspect the property a few times a year but do not tell you about this before signing the contract and do not give a reasonable window of time for when to expect them. They are very quick to follow up, though, if they need something from their tenants instead. \n\r\nThe landlords of this property have also refused to fix issues like leaking taps, a barely working toilet flush, and very severe mould issues in various places in the property, due to very poor insulation. In fact, they asked us to paint over the mould on walls, and never took any responsibility for it despite us sending the agency photos of the walls and some of our belongings being covered in mould. We have, as a result of all this, suffered with cough and chilblains in the winter.  \r\nWhen we first moved in we had to ask them to replace door handles in certain rooms in order for the doors to close, as they expected people to live there without even having doors that close in the bedrooms, the main bathroom, and the cupboards.   \n\r\nAt the end of the tenancy, Hobdays did not release our deposit within the 10-day limit as the law requires, did not give us any updates unless we chased them up persistently to get our money back, and did not take any steps to return our (full) deposit until we reminded them that withholding our deposit without a reason is unlawful. Several weeks later, they finally returned our deposit without even apologising for once again breaking the law and unnecessarily wasting our time.  \n\r\nOverall, the landlords of this property and Hobdays are by far the worst we have ever had to deal with - unreliable, unempathic, irresponsible.","474":"Very old property with serious mould issue and unfixed broken and locked windows. Very poor service by proper agents and by landlord who does not care less about anything and has no interest whatsoever in fixing any thing. BIG WARNING","475":null,"476":"Everything was fixed instantly after it was reported. Landlords are lovely. Highly recommended. You pay per room. Most are ensuite and very large.","477":"The property is owned by a local Church and they were only interested in getting their rent not in maintaining or investing any time or money in the property. The garage was broken into, I had to pay for the repairs to make it secure again. The washing machine broke several times and after 6 months of continual complaint we eventually got a new one. Same with the gas hob, took over a year to get new one, despite only two of four rings working. The boiler was supposedly serviced but came home to flooded kitchen and boiler wouldn\\'t light. Resolved ourselves using local boiler guy. Carpets were cheap nasty and never replaced, bought our own carpet cleaner in the end. The property had old single glazed windows and were lead glass in places. These were poorly maintained and falling apart and couldn\\'t really be opened. They also leaked heat and the house never properly heated up due to this. In the end when things broke in the house we fixed them and paid for repairs ourselves as waiting for repairs would have taken weeks to months. No good when boiler is broken. We also had a continual problem with slugs in the house as there were so many ways they could get in due to poor maintenance and fit of doors, skirting boards etc. The bathroom was often mouldy as the extractor fan rarely if ever worked. The toilet regularly leaked sewage and was repaired several times, but never well enough to stop the leak entirely. One of the final straws was rising damp in the floor level kitchen cupboards which ruined anything not in a tin. The Church property manager  came round once and basically patronized us with his attitude. When we complained he said the church is a charity and we said no you are our landlord and we expect that you deal with us as such. He was a pompous man. I can\\'t recommend renting this house after our experience. Also the letting agents were useless.","478":null,"479":"We moved here because it is not a too bad area and it was close to our workplace for a reasonable price. But...\r\nI would not recommend this property for a number of reasons.\r\n- Huge insulation problems!\r\nThe main bedroom has no insulation at all so does not matter how long you keep the heating on, the moment when you turn it off the room starts to cool down rapidly. It is freezing cold at winter time.\r\nThe same with the bathroom.\r\nBut the biggest problem is the house has no water insulation!!! That means after every rainy day all the walls are soaking wet! After two weeks the paint came off the walls and the mould started to grow everywhere! We contacted the agency several times, but they did nothing about it! We had to use a dehumidifier and take it from room to room. It was going 24\/7 to control humidity. That obviously cost us a lot of money to buy and run. No compensation whatsoever from the landlord!\r\nAnd if you think that was the worst, think again.\r\n- The worst thing we had to face there caused by the landlord himself when he decided that the easiest way to get rid of the dirty water in the kitchen is to connect the waste pipe into the rainwater highway just front of the house what is obviously illegal!! Yes, that is right! So all the tenants over the years polluted the water with everything what goes down in a kitchen sink without knowing it! \r\nWe just realised what is going on when it blocked completely. The agency sent someone who fixed it than they sent the bill to us to pay for it! We did not pay fortunately because after that it happened again every 3 month.  A manager from the water highways tried to sort the issue out with the landlord, but he was never available. It is still an ongoing problem. \r\nWhen it blocked last time, everybody refused to clean it out, so we could not use the whole kitchen area! No washing machine, no dishwasher, nothing. And the solution? The landlord idea was to move all the machines to the back! Into one of the bedrooms!! Hey? At this point we had enough.\n\r\nAll in all it was a very bad experience with both the landlord and the agency. \r\nEvery time we reported something the agency was not able to reach the landlord therefore they never sorted any problem out. I had to do everything myself. I am glad it is over now! I just wish that the law would be more powerful against these type of agencies and landlords. These kind of properties should never be rented out to humans to live in them! :-(","480":"The noise from the adjoining rooms (the landlords practice) is very loud as if they are in the house with you. Landlord often crossed the professional line entering property\/garden without notice\/permission. Keep records of all correspondence and report issues straight away. Sad that after nearly a decade of a good relationship was ruined by claims that I was responsible for water damage. A clear attempt at scrambling for deposit. Naively takes advice from money driven property agents without regard for personal relationships.","481":null,"482":"The flat itself was lovely and done to a high standard, however our experience with the landlord was just so difficult from start to finish.\n\r\nTo begin with, my bathroom had a mould problem in my bathroom due to a lack of ventilation or fan which I reported to the landlord in October 2019. It took months to be resolved, and I had to eventually threaten council intervention if this wasn\\'t fixed. Eventually, in late February 2020 - nearly 5 months later - I was given a dehumidifier after the landlord claimed (wrongly) that they hadn\\'t been made aware of the problem (she had been - five times in writing via email and WhatsApp). This was especially distressing since I have breathing issues, which were exacerbated by this problem, and I was essentially blamed for letting the problem get \\'out of control\\' by the landlord instead of simply being apologised to for having to put up with it for so long. There was no adequate ventilation, which is in direct contravention to the Housing Act.\n\r\nInsult duly added to injury, the landlord then turfed my housemates and me out of the property in the midst of a global pandemic, citing that they needed to \\'sell the property\\' (when, in fact, it was promptly put back up onto the market to let at a reduced rate). They then proceeded to conjure up \u00a32,000 worth of damages (amongst which, an extra \u00a3400 for cleaning when we paid \u00a3270 for a professional end-of-tenancy cleaning company to come in, with receipt as evidence), all of which we are currently STILL contesting through the TDPS.\n\r\nIn short: nice place, awful landlord. Do not rent this property if you value honesty, decency, and holding on to your money. If it\\'s too good to turn down, take as many pictures as humanly possible before you even unpack a single item.","483":null,"484":null,"485":null,"486":"The property is in a convenient location, and the block is very nice and with a well-kept garden. The flat is of good quality compared to other properties I have seen, but probably not worth the \u00a3600 per month of rent, as asked by the landlord. The room is advertised as \\\"en suite\\\", however the landlord will use your bathroom (which is actually in the corridor) mostly for showering, and will not clean it. Large HD TV is a very nice feature of the flat, and nice views on parks and guildhall clock tower. Overall I would recommend this property, but be aware that the landlord might be particular about the way you may wish to enjoy the property. \n\r\nTo prospective lodgers: remember that you will be a lodger and not a tenant. Lodgers in a live-in landlord situation do not enjoy the same rights as tenants of live-out landlord properties. As a lodger you will have to abide by the rules of the landlord, as unreasonable as they may sound to you. See below for some examples of how that might affect your stay.\n\r\n The landlord works from the living room, which is not available during the day, and sometimes also in the evenings and weekends, so be prepared to not be able to use it at your convenience. This caused a major inconvenience during my stay, especially as no reduction on rent was agreed. The landlord wasn\\'t responsive to this issue despite my repeated complaints. I wouldn\\'t be able to use the room even before he started working in the morning, as this would \\\"cause a distraction\\\" to him. Use of the desk in the living room is not allowed even when the landlord is away. \n\r\n The landlord is very concerned with keeping the property in a good state, perhaps limiting your freedom of action in the flat. For instance,  food is not allowed in the living room, or in the bedroom. Moreover, expect not being able to have friends round, which is seen as an inconvenience by the landlord even when he works from site and during daytime, as they would cause \\\"extra wear and tear\\\". Friends in the evenings are allowed \\\"infrequently\\\" as per the tenancy agreement (somehow that doesn\\'t cause \\\"wear and tear\\\") but expect the landlord to ask you to let them go after 11 pm (this has actually happened to me, and we were being very quiet and with the door closed. Eventually I stopped having friends over when he was there to avoid being embarrassed again by this behaviour.) By contrast, it has often happened that he would make noise after that time, including showering and cooking even at my request to stop that as I was going through a period of severe insomnia.\n\r\nPartners in a long distance relationship are however welcome to stay up to a week per month, and the landlord has shown flexibility with more frequent visits, which I appreciated.

She then tried to deny that she had received the notice. Thankfully the letting agent told me that she had lied. She also attempted to breach the tenancy fees act and demanded a professional clean. When it came to the deposit return she claimed to not know how to return it despite it being held by her in a personal bank account.\n\r\nIt was all ok in the end but the sheer stress she caused was ridiculous and unprofessional.

She couldn\\'t move easily - or she would have- because of personal circumstances, and the fact that everywhere else in Oxford was even more unaffordable. She never once went into arrears or broke any of the terms of the tenancy. Despite her loyalty and being an extremely \\'well-behaved\\' tenant, the landlady was extremely reluctant to spend money on anything. The property was old and run down and hadn\\'t been refurbished for years. Whenever fixtures and fittings legally needed replacing, they were reluctantly replaced with something cheaper or even older than the fixture or fitting that had broken. The property was broken into and burgled within a month of my wife renting it because of poor security. Then the landlady tried to charge my wife for putting new locks in! The washing machine broke over my wife\\'s first Christmas there, but the landlady waited for three weeks to fix it (leaving my wife having to use a launderette while she had a 6 year old and very young baby) because the landlady wanted to get it fixed on the final two months of its ten year guarantee. The repairman deemed it unfixable after all that, and the landlady replaced with a 6 year old machine, which almost instantly broke. Once, during a storm, a whole top window fell out of the external wall, including the rotten frame, on to the pavement below. Luckily nobody was walking below at that minute or they would have been seriously injured or killed. It was left boarded up for a month while the landlady argued with her insurers. The fence then collapsed.Again, it was left like that for about two months, because of more  arguments between t he landlady and her insurers. Then half the the liviing room ceiling collapsed due to the unsealed tiles in the bathroom  overhead leaking water into the walls. The landlady then made me and my wife pay out of  our own pockets for a hotel room for  a week while it was all fixed. There were countless other issues. All of the landlady\\'s bad behaviour was supported by the estate agents, who were rude and patronising and even aggressive at all times about getting \r\n anything  fixed, as if it was our fault - even though we were paying \u00a31150 pcm for this two up-two down  property! (,I found out, was formerly a pig sty- for real!) We have  now moved to Hampshire and cannot believe the difference in our experience - we no longer feel ripped off or completely disrespected.

I\\'m just in the middle of moving out of this property with one of my housemates and we have both decided to leave as a consequence of the landlord\\'s toxic behavior and unfair house rules. \n\r\nOn arrival, the house was very clean and remained that way throughout my stay but I didn\\'t realise that this was as a result of his stringent and obsessive cleaning. In our group chat, we received sometimes up to 5 messages per day including pictures of minute spots of dirt and passive-aggressive messages stating that it was our obligation to keep the house to his standards. He used his housemate who he states is his \\'best friend\\' as a leverage point to guilt-trip us into cleaning, stating that his friend was always complaining about the house (which he wasn\\'t as he never mentioned anything to me and when I asked him if there were any issues he didn\\'t have any)! \n\r\nAnother example of the unusual rules can be displayed in a scenario that happened last week. There were repairs going on in the middle bathroom (which me and my housemate use) and we were informed by the Plumber that we were to not use it for 24 hours. There\\'s a second bathroom upstairs and we asked to use it but he wouldn\\'t allow us to use the bathroom for just one day. He wouldn\\'t explain why and only gave an obscure and heated response when he shouted at me and stated that its his bathroom and he keeps it pristine and to his standards. \n\r\nI can only describe my experience in this property as negative as I felt as if I was in a hotel rather than a house. I mostly stayed in my room and kitchen as I wouldn\\'t feel comfortable anywhere else. There wasn\\'t one day where there wasn\\'t a complaint from him regarding a switch, crumb stain or threat to evict us.\n\r\nLast month he decided to increase the rent by \u00a3100 extra PCM because in his words he was undergoing \\'financial issues\\'. In light of this unprofessionalism, he did not grant me a new agreement and has stated that I owe him \u00a3110 for the last week of stay. I implore this landlord to rethink his understanding of what lodgers\\' rights are and to understand that other lodgers have their own lives and cannot feel as though they are under the radar 24\/7. \n\r\nTo top it all off he has decided to install cameras into the property in the front room, kitchen and hallway as he spotted me cleaning my shoes with the door open for 1 minute and confronted me in a passive-aggressive tone. At most times I felt confronted and very uncomfortable. \n\r\nI would not suggest staying here and stay well away from this landlord\\'s next property viewing.","500":null,"501":"Property has a huge issued with damp and mould that the landlord seems is aware from complaints by previous tenants. \n\r\nWe are stuck in a mouldy hell.\n\r\nThe washing machine has black mould which he has refused to replace.\n\r\nPlace has been done cheap as possible.","502":"Found the room to be exactly what I needed and the rent very fair. The room is on the same floor as the communal bathroom which I found to almost never be occupied. The kitchen is clean and I found that I always had space for my food and belongings. The other housemates during my stay were all friendly young professionals. The property is in a very convenient location, it is not only 15 minutes from the centre of Birmingham by bus but because of its location means areas such as West Bromwich where I worked during my stay here are also easily accessible. The estate that its on is quiet and seems quite family orientated. It is also worth mentioning that as a landlord Martin was very responsive and helpful. Overall I was delighted with my time at the property.","503":"The landlord took 4 months to return my deposit after leaving. I also had no knowledge when he moved someone else into my room.

We have had a lot of problems with our boiler and washing machine which was provided by the landlord. It is still waiting to be fixed. The stairs are extremely steep and narrow, unsafe for everyone. I recently fell down them carrying my baby in her car seat. The banister is unsafe and can be climbed by my toddler. The windows, floors and skirting boards are all ilfitting and we have a constant breeze coming in. The kitchen cupboards are poorly fitted and we don\\'t have a proper worktop, just a piece of mdf.

The worst part was that due to the noise \u2018resonating\u2019 from our flat into their house, we were not allowed to talk or walk in certain rooms past 11pm, or faced harrassment via a group chat from the landlord\u2019s wife.

Broken tiles were \\'fixed\\' with red tape, the basement floor with 2 bedrooms always smelled damp (we were very kindly given 1 dehumidifier for the 7 bed house, lol), and the stairwell had paint peeling off the walls. The agents we rented from, Sugarhouse, either weren\\'t aware of these problems, or didn\\'t deal with them. This is a review from when I lived there a few years ago, so it may be different now, but this wasn\\'t even a particularly cheap student house - it cost us \u00a3301 pppm at the time, so the landlord rakes in over \u00a325,000 a year from it!","515":"Flooded several times due to uostairs neighbour.

Found landlords and letting agent very fair and accommodating regarding most aspects of property. \r\nUnfortunately the house has various pests: worst are the rats in the attic and mites in the bedrooms. These are extremely difficult to rid the property of, which is a shame as it is otherwise a really nice house.","520":"Awful property and awful letting agents - Hightop property.

The bath would always block and the agent tried to recharge us for this, despite the plumber saying the pipes were on a slant and it would keep re-blocking. we were recharged \u00a360 to clean the bedroom when we left, despite it being cleaned beforehand. There was no ventilation in the kitchen or bathroom. the kitchen was in a hazardous place and blocked the fire exit from the bathroom and one of the bedrooms. there is no kitchen storage for food or cooking utensils. There are frequent drug users around the blocks of flats, and quite often groups of teenagers would congregate in the basketball court and playground opposite and be very noisy, drinking, and violent - we had to call the police almost every week. Poorly lit surrounding area, so it feels very unsafe. Communal areas in the block had dog urine. Really, this flat should have been a 2 bedroom flat with a proper sized kitchen and living area - the landlord has converted it into a 4 bedroom flat with a tiny, dangerous kitchen and no living area. Cramped, uncomfortable, unsafe living conditions.","521":"I have been asked to clean this up for legal reasons.\r\nThe owner is shifty and has no morals.\r\nBeware.","522":null,"523":"No problems at all living here.

The letting agency tried to refuse to refund the despoit, claiming we did damage to the flat that was there before we moved in and giving us a more detailed inventory than when we moved in (8 pages to 70 pages). The landlord decided to give us the full deposit despite this.","527":"Where to begin.  There is no check in process so be sure to take extensive photos of the property before you move in the landlord only does an inventory.  The landlord himself is not helpful, he will not reply to emails or pick up the phone.  The flat is nasty, it was a fit of madness that made us rent this.  The small bedroom and kitchen has no insulation so got down to 8 degrees in winter the rest of the flat has single glazing so also gets quite cold.  The bathroom has no ventilation so was covered in black mould after a month or so.  The boiler has a fault which the landlord told us to pay to be fixed and there is a leak in the central heating system somewhere.  Mice were a relatively regular occurrence.  The landlord was not helpful with any issues.  The selling point (a big terrace at the back) is being sold and tenants will lose access to it (although we were told this by the surveyors not the landlord).  At the end of the tenancy the landlord ignored me for a month and then tried to make deductions from our deposit.  However after I threatened him with court action he paid up in full.  His deposit registry account was cancelled as he broke the rules of the scheme, he registered the incorrect sum and didn\\'t provide the prescribed information as required by Housing Act 2004.  I am still considering court action over this.  The letting agent is equally unhelpful.

I can vouch for the pub. Excellent food and nice atmosphere.\r\nWaggoners Farm Barn,  we were there for 18 months and it\u2019s probably the worst place we\u2019ve ever stayed in. Having come from a converted barn, we are used to old buildings with their individual problems but this thing is something else. The roof leaked in a number of places due to holes and rotten Velux windows which the landlord continually patched up rather than replace. However the worst one is above the bedroom which is caused by the poor installation of solar panels and it leaks in directly above where the bed would go, so it\u2019s a good idea to wear waterproofs when you go to bed and it\u2019s raining. The panels would have to be removed and re fitted I was told to get to the problem.\r\nVirtually all the windows are rotten and the glazing blown, the inside has loose electrical wires that have been taped up. All the carpets are worn, tatty and stained. Be careful  as the landlord tried to blame us for this. The only thing that saved us was the inventory which showed the original condition.\r\nIf you rent, don\u2019t expect anything to be done quickly.  When the alarm failed due to getting soaked by a leaking wall, The landlord pleaded poverty to us saying he couldn\\'t afford to get it repaired.\r\nThe garage door doesn\u2019t work properly and the stop cock freezes in the winter as the insulation in the garage where it is, is virtually none existent.\r\nThen the central heating. The boiler is antiquated and will stay on 24\/7 when the temperature drops, burning your very expensive heating oil. You cannot turn it off as the garage ambient temperature can drop to freezing.\r\nThe large room at the back is serviced by two cast iron radiators that are in-effective and a small log burner. You may as well light a candle for all the good that does. We had to vacate the room from November to May as it was impossible to heat. And the radiators are separate from the main heating system so are on all the time, not that it makes any difference to the temp.\r\nWhen we were there, the Aga didn\u2019t work properly and was on maximum all the time and you could not adjust the temperature. The engineer refused to come back out because, in his words,  the landlord took weeks to pay their last bill.  This is also a real pain because in the summer you cannot turn it off as you have no alternative means of cooking, so you bake.\r\nThe back bathroom smells from the drains from time to time\r\nIt is very noisy being in the main road as you would expect\r\nIf you were to rent this, expect to refill the oil tank at least once every two months at a current cost of about \u00a31000\r\nIf you are thinking of buying it, get a full structural survey done. We were told by trades men it probably needs \u00a3150,000 spending on it to get it to a decent standard and for that you could buy a house in a much nicer condition and in a far quieter, nicer location.\r\nI believe the owners described it as a palace to the letting agents.  You can judge for yourself, but I would say a dilapidated shack would be more accurate and decorated to a cheap and tacky standard in our opinion.","530":"Mould on the bedroom wall, this was painted over. Kitchen has no extraction system leading outside so lots of condensation. \n\r\nQuite noisy due to being just off the high street with a bus stop directly in front of the property. \n\r\nThere was no heating in the kitchen and got very very cold during winter months as it\\'s an end of terrace flat and top floor. \n\r\nFlat was left even cleaner than check in yet was charged for cleaning. Tried charging for a damaged kitchen top which was there at check in. \n\r\nThe hallway leading up to the flat has fraying carpets - easy to trip over","531":"Great property and fantastic location. But architecturally, poorly built. The top floor gets extremely hot in summers almost to the point that you need an actual AC as 2 fans and open windows in each room become pointless. Similarly, the ground floor in winters is so cold, that you can\\'t use the kitchen and conservatory at all even with heaters on full blast (which made the top floors unbearably hot again!). Bills ran into \u00a3213\/month for gas and electric. \n\r\nOtherwise, it\\'s amazing. Big garage, nice garden, location is stunning, driveway and off street parking spots around the house. Landlord is a genuinely good guy. Lives abroad.","532":"I was forced to stay in an illegal, unsafe and unhealthy environment for 11 months. I rented the residence through a lettings agent, the landlord seemed a nice old lady (which was important as she was living within 10 feet of me), but once everything was signed and I was on her hook, she turned into a volatile, aggressive stalker.\r\nI was not allowed to park my car on the driveway I was paying for unless I reversed in, I wasn\\'t allowed to park with the back end of my car facing the street. There are no reason given for this demand.\r\nI wasn\\'t always allowed to use the parking spot I was paying for as the landlord liked to use the space for repotting their plants.\r\nThere was a leak in the bathroom taps when I first moved in, I was told this would be sorted, but I\\'ve moved out and the leak is still going strong, it has added to my water bill and wasn\\'t even my fault to fix.\r\nI was told when to turn my lights out at night, and if I didn\\'t, there is a switch on the outside of the house which the landlord would use to switch off my lights whether I wanted them off or not!\r\nI discovered there were lots of rats and mice within the property when I first moved in, but instead of paying an exterminator, I was told the property is old and the walls have cavities which mice and rats like to live in, so I could set my own traps if I wanted. Nothing more was ever done.\r\nWhen I first moved in I was told I was not allowed to move the landlord\\'s two rugs within the property, despite them smelling foul. Once day I rolled up one of the rugs and stored it safely away and hours later I got a text demanding to know where the other rug was. The landlord can\\'t even see into the property without entering it so this left me confused and scared.\r\nThere were also massive cracks in the walls and gaps in all the window sills which allowed hornets, insects and even birds into the property, which the landlord refused to do anything about.\r\nI enquired about getting my own bins as I paid council tax and required my own, but the landlord forced me to share hers and shouted at me down the phone one day when I asked, forbidding me getting my own bins as she didn\\'t want any extra on the property. This led to the council finding out she never put through planning permission on my residence. I pleaded with the lettings agent to let me out of the tenancy contract as it should have been void after the property was found to be illegal, but they refused.\r\nDue to the stalking and harassment on a daily basis from the landlord I had to seek mental health help.\r\nI have just moved out over a month early which has cost me direly, and the landlord has demanded a lot of illegal things of me since I had given her my notice, including sending me bills which I have no idea what they\\'re for, and billing me for things that aren\\'t in my contract. Again, I\\'ve tried getting help from the lettings agent, but they feel they have no duty of care to me as they are making money off the landlord.","533":null,"534":"This was the worst rental experience I have had in almost 10 years so this will be a long post but please consider your mental health before you live here. It was a lodger situation but the complete lack of regard for someone else\\'s privacy and property was horrendous - privacy and autonomy were non-existent. \n\r\nThe landlord walked into my bedroom without knocking while I was in bed and then stood in the doorway, and said they weren\\'t expecting me to be at home and in my bed. They then proceeded to walk further into the room to look for something (though why they thought one of their possessions was in my room I don\\'t know) and only stepped out when I asked them to because again, I was in bed in a state of undress and needed to put on a dressing gown. In the hallway, the landlord acted like I was insane for being uncomfortable with the situation and when I tried to bring it up later they would not agree to knock before entering the room. I was left extremely uncomfortable and never knew when they\\'d walk in unannounced again (the room had no lock). \r\nSimilarly, the bathroom door actually had a lock on it but the landlord would try to open the door, discover it locked, then continue trying to open the door which felt very threatening. \n\r\nThis is a hygiene issue - the landlord would go to the toilet in the middle of the night and would not shut the door while they were on the toilet and then they wouldn\\'t flush! Every morning I would have to see their urine in the toilet, which is completely inappropriate when you\\'re choosing to rent a room in your home. Flush the toilet, it\\'s simple. \n\r\nNot only was sleep difficult due to an incessant tapping sound at night (presumably due to the heating that is always on though never in the rented bedroom), but it was also absolutely freezing in the room. The landlord did explain the heating (though their understanding was limited) but, despite having never changing it myself, sent me accusatory messages about how expensive the heating bill was, seemingly unaware of the global heating crisis. \n\r\nThe landlord went away on a trip and had their friends staying which was mostly fine but the landlord had obviously told them to help themselves to anything which meant that it was exclusively my food that was eaten without my permission, it was not replaced. \n\r\nThe landlord was very intrusive in my life, I brought my belongings into the home and into my room and the landlord insisted on commenting on my possessions (which I now assume is because they were in my room and going through my things to \\\"look for something\\\"). They also tried to get me to throw stuff away. This was a personal thing, but I think a lodger is just as entitled to their privacy. \n\r\nThe rental was advertised as a bedroom in a home with a SHARED kitchen, living room, dining room, bathrooms and parking. There was no private parking or parking outside the house (despite it being a feature in the ad). The landlord also does not like people owning cars (and yet exclusively takes Ubers or taxis) so lectured me frequently about having a car - my only way to get to work. \r\nThe living room was not shared. I used it once and the landlord got angry at me for sitting on the sofa so I had to spend all of my time in my room. The kitchen was shared but I got a tiny shelf in a cupboard, a shelf in the fridge and no freezer space. I was able to cook in the kitchen by myself once, otherwise the landlord would be in there lecturing me. I wasn\\'t able to use the dining room either. \n\r\nThe landlord accused me of stealing packages and mail (it was then delivered a few days later). And then when I couldn\\'t find one of my packages it turned out that they had seen it earlier in the week, assumed it was for them (they hadn\\'t ordered anything and it had my name on it) and took it for themselves!\n\r\nFinally, the landlord looked after someone\\'s cat and, when I wasn\\'t there, they would open the door to my room for the cat to climb over my bed (there were dirty paw prints all over the sheets) and go through my belongings. Again, total lack of regard for my possessions or privacy. \n\r\nIn summary, this room was far too expensive for what was offered and I felt violated my entire time there.","535":"To be fair and honest, The property is in very good shape, its a very old one but well-refurbished. The only draw back and negative things are a couple of thing:\n\r\n1- The landlady could\\'ve told me that my neighbours are drug dealers and has lots of bad visitors who could get really loud and annoying at night (I know I should\\'ve asked but it some essential things slip off the brain on the right times)!\n\r\n2- I have suffered from a couple of thefts within less than a year! my bike was stolen from my back garden where someone jumped in and took it.\n\r\n3- Few months after my laptop got nicked out of the car as I unfortunately left it open.\r\nOn the bright side the landlady is super responsive and a very  descent lady. When I complained over the thefts she offered me another property to move into, however I don\\'t feel like moving anywhere else near this area after all what happened. The insulation of the house was outstanding although its E or D I guess but I saved a lot in bills in comparison with my previous uninsulated rented house.","536":"Landlords are very poor. Year round issues such as cracked windows never fixed. Issues with broken light electrics were never fixed. No notice for viewings with people randomly turning up throughout the day unannounced (during a pandemic as well) and they constantly cc random email addresses into our correspondence.","537":"The Landlord insisted to pay him by cash, in my opinion, it looks like he doesn\\'t want to pay taxes from this money.\r\nThere are BEDBUGS in the property, he tried to fix the problem several times but without great success, they will bite you every night.\r\nVery noisy, the insulation of the room is very poor, so you hear your roommates and neighbors on the upper floor. Even if your roommates speak not very loud you cannot sleep because you hear them clearly.\n\r\nThis landlord invented the rule that each room must clear the whole property twice per week. Toilet, kitchen, common areas etc.\r\nWhy not 3 or 4 times per week? This is totally unacceptable behavior because the property was in a reasonable good condition, we (tenants) were looking after it.\n\r\nThe toilet was constantly clogged because it was not properly connected to the sewage, as a result, there were constant blockages and you just couldn\\'t wash it off, all sewage was floating and does not go away, you needed to clean it all the time. Even if cleaned, the next time it becomes clogged again.\n\r\nThe overall landlord\\'s behavior I can describe as arrogant, you feel yourself like he is doing you a favor by renting out the poor quality rooms, probably he forgot that we are paying him the money, not vice versa.\n\r\nI would recommend to fellows-tenants to Avoid this property and this Landlord, don\\'t waste your time and money","538":null,"539":null,"540":null,"541":"Took 3 months to start return of deposit.

Windows need to be constantly left ajar, even in the depths of winter. Any mention to this to the landlord falls on death ears with his response being to open the windows more, even when it is snowing. One day with the heating on constantly the temperature in the flat did not reach above 13.5 degrees (this was when it was snowing I will add). The external walls in the bedroom and it being a ground floor flat mean it is naturally a very cold flat at times. In the summer that\u2019s great as it\u2019s cool, but in the winter unless you can afford to have the heating on constantly it can become unbearable. We did suffer with black mould whilst in the flat. In 20 months I spent well over \u00a3100 trying to keep it under control, and not even so much as an offer of a dehumidifier from the landlord.....  The bedroom was the worst affected, but it also affected the lounge, bathroom and hallway. Despite keeping all windows ajar there was bad damp in the hallway which caused paint to fall off. And, then was charged for the cost of this out of deposit when leaving. Despite flagging the issue to the landlord on numerous occasions. To be fair to the landlord any other issues in the flat were always dealt with. Anything else he was always quickly on the case and had things sorted.","545":"Extremely friendly and helpful landlord, very easy to contact and work with, sorted problems fast. Estate agent\/management average.","546":null,"547":null,"548":null,"549":null,"550":"This landlord is absolutely awful, the house is in disrepair. The boiler does not work and he refuses to fix. Light fittings are leaking water, the front door allows water under it. His idea of solving a mould problem is to scrape it off every now and then. He did not clean the house before we moved in dispite us specifically asking and on top of this he is one of the most rude men I have ever met in my life. Avoid this place like the plague.","551":"The flat is a good size, and bright. The heating system does not work properly - it involves lighting a match and trying to find the pilot light under the boiler. This was pointed out to the landlord at an early stage and subsequently several times, but not fixed by the time we left. The heating system is also not efficient in the slightest - the bedroom part heats up a lot, whilst downstairs barely heats up at all. However, the main problem as the other review points out is the noise - trains come past the flat all day\/night, and unfortunately due to a nearby level crossing always horn just as they go past. This makes sleep\/relaxing difficult.\r\nThe other main problem came in regards to our deposit. Shortly before the end of the tenancy, there was a noticeable change in attitude over emails from the landlord. The landlord then attempted to retain \u00a3100 for carpet\/oven\/wall cleaning at the end of the tenancy.  We strongly objected to this - both in terms of the amount and the fact that any extra cleaning was needed at all. The landlord was very unwilling to come to a fair agreement, and unfortunately we had to use the Deposit dispute process. Fortunately, having picked up the Landlord\\'s change in attitude, I managed to take photos of most areas of the flat during check-out to prove the condition that it was left in. In the end, the dispute service returned the majority of the \u00a3100 that the landlord sought to retain.\r\nThough the flat is spacious considering it is only one bedroom, I would not recommend it because of the noise, and landlord.","552":null,"553":null,"554":null,"555":null,"556":null,"557":"On the whole a great little house.

It was first noted in December 2020 and as of October 2021 is still not fixed. As a result of this, it has caused damage to my personal belongings as well as unknown damage to the wall. I have videos with the extent of the damage too.","559":"Absolutely appalling letting agency, Student Choices. I would not wish for anyone to live there. People working the at the letting agency are highly unprofessional, they come in without written notice, do not take issues such as leaks, and rats and mouse seriously. When informed about rat problem first they completely ignored the issue and believed it is not their fault (a cleaner is hired by them to clean communal areas so they are responsible and the property is kept responsibly clean). I personally bough rats\/mouse traps and scattered them around the house. A year later the same problem occurred but this time mice was found in lounge\/kitchen area and in bedrooms! For obvious reason I reported it straight away to the agency, and they came into to the room looked around and said the mouse isn\\'t there anymore and asked me if I was seeing things! Very disrespectful and their only response was that \\\"it happens\\\"! It wouldn\\'t have happens if there weren\\'t holes in the walls in baseman and in the living rooms but once again they are taking no action. Thankfully I only have a month left at this property but unfortunately I already paid my rent, otherwise I would have moved out right away. \n\r\nSave yourself time and stress and go to a different letting agency, they are the worst one around.","560":"The landlord was awful to deal with during the check out process - in the end I had to go to the deposit dispute process, which was awarded in my favour as below:\n\r\n\\\"I cannot completely disregard the fact that I find the deterioration in the\r\ncondition and the cleanliness of the property, d\u00e9cor and carpets to be relatively minor,\r\neasily rectifiable and relatively isolated and thus, not significant or extensive enough to\r\njustify the sum being claimed by the Landlord so, having also considered likely minimum\r\nlabour and material costs of independent contractors, I am satisfied a contribution of\r\n\u00a3290.00, being approximately 70% of the sum claimed, is more fair and reasonable in\r\nthe circumstances and more proportionate to the Tenant\u2019s liability so, bearing in mind the\r\nLandlord has already retained \u00a3190.00, I award the Landlord the remaining difference of\r\n\u00a3100.00.\n\r\n6.3 When reaching this Decision, I have also considered the fact that the Landlord has not\r\nshown that the holes could not have been filled in and touched up at a lesser cost than a\r\nfull repaint of said area(s), and I find that the Landlord should at least attempt to mitigate\r\nall of the potential losses that are to be incurred from the Deposit of the Tenant.\\\"\n\r\nNot only was he excessive in his attempted deductions from my deposit, he was very aggressive and unpleasant to deal with during the process.","561":null,"562":"The actual property is nice - it could do with being repainted and the furniture was worn but satisfactory. The main downside to this property is the landlord - she is nitpicky at best and intrusive at worst. She is extremely particular about her property, insisting on professional cleans before the tenancy starts \\'as a courtesy to the incoming tenants\\' - except that of course she takes \u00a3300 out of your deposit when you leave. She is neurotic and when we discovered an awful cockroach infestation in the property within a month or so of moving there, she passively aggressively suggested that we had caused this, despite the fact that there were full-grown cockroaches and so many of them that it was impossible to have started less than two months ago. We had to calm her down as she was very stressed by the cockroaches even though we had to live with it, and berated us for not cleaning crumbs from under the toaster. This is also after she complimented us on how clean the flat is when she comes round. She went for a cheaper option to get rid of the bugs which ultimately didn\\'t work, and so we actually had to move out for five weeks while the house was fumigated. She \\'kindly\\' didn\\'t charge us rent for those five weeks that we were unable to live there and only properly fumigated the house when we put our foot down to say that the flat is uninhabitable - there were cockroaches in every room of the house at this point. When we gave notice to leave after a year, she voiced her disappointment, only to come round before we had even moved out to measure blinds and curtains, as well as point out minor scuffs on the wall, ask us to hoover the mattress and insist that everything was put back exactly as it was when we moved in (an ugly mirror on the dresser, the paintings back exactly in the right place on the wall etc). She made us feel so uncomfortable that we actually left the property while she remained to do more checks (?) - again, this is BEFORE our tenancy had finished. Luckily we had already moved to our new property as the tenancies overlapped. Overall, I would say it\\'s a shame that the property has such an invasive landlord, as the flat itself is lovely (sans cockroaches, which was solved eventually) and we were really looking forward to living in our first home together as a couple. Unfortunately, it was tainted by a \u00a3300 deduction from our deposit for a professional clean, which altogether was ironic given her house was full of bugs and we kept it impeccably clean. In short, would not recommend at all if you want to keep your sanity.","563":null,"564":"I am profoundly deaf, I have many see my document  doctor more files 3 or 4 document affect my family problem breath as well my son start ashsa spray 3 months ago and inspection bugs is worse in bathroom as well kitchen and living room \n\r\nI am not happy home so I have PIP higher rate disabled because I have no work","565":null,"566":"Agency honest but willing to negotiate landlord fair.","567":null,"568":null,"569":"This 5 bedroom property is rented out by a private landlord with his own agency \u201cSmartroom rental\u201d.

The landlord is focused only on getting money and not about the people living in his multiple properties. They have put a homeless person in our flat as the legally cant rent it out as the room is too small but now they get an income. The flat smells of urine since the new guy moved in and the landlord is not doing much about it. He needed to make a room bigger and so he broke through one of the bedrooms walls and decreased the size of that room to increase the size of the other. They won\u2019t give a reference 7ntil you give your notice to leave and they overcharge for any damage eg( small stain on bed and they wanted \u00a3200). The other tenant had to contact DPS to make sure they didn\u2019t get away with it. In the end it was only a \u00a330 charge. The will try take your whole deposit from you through outrageous charges. They have also tried to charge every tennant \u00a320-\u00a330 a month extra to have a barely acceptable cleaner in. I would just avoid this company as the stress and financial loss is not worth it.","570":"The landlords insisted on all tenants (this was a shared house) on signing up to one contract with no possibility of giving notive individually apart from at the six month and year points. This also meant sharing liability for the rent of the whole house. I was made aware of this very late in the process and when trying to renegotiate clauses in the contract,  the landlord used emotional pressure on the other tenants who pleaded with me to go ahead (as they would otherwise have to cover the rent). \n\r\nThe house was poorly insulated, with old leaky windows, had a strange mixture of a wooden (half-rotting) and cement floor in the kitchen, and window in the living room could not be opened leaving the air stale. \n\r\nAt least two of the bedrooms had serious mould issues. \n\r\nWhen one of my flatmates complained the mould problem was affecting her health,  the landlords showed little concern.\n\r\nThe house was in a terrible condition and should have extensively refurbished and repaired.","571":"Positive elements - large property with lots of parking, a garage and outbuildings. Its in a good location but on busy road. Large front and rear garden, perfect neighbours. Reasonable rent.\r\nNegative elements - cold, damp and mouldy, most windows have no functioning seals and are draughty - this makes the property very expensive to heat - fixes were promised but never materialised. Very old kitchen in very poor state with painted tiles that flake all the time. Very poor carpets throughout with no underlay, again adding to the heating expense. Conservatory leaks very badly and is unusable, water ingress to the room adjoining the conservatory. Downstairs toilet is cold, damp and mouldy. Large garden is very difficult and time consuming to maintain as the landlord offers no assistance or tools. Landlord took weeks to offer a retention figure for the deposit which was very unfair and the amount requested unreasonable, we are still wrangling over the retention some 6 weeks after moving out. Overall the house is big but dilapidated and hard to live in. It\\'s on a very busy road and there is a constant motorway hum - made worse by the ineffective double glazing. Only the very bare minimum of maintenance is performed. Be very careful to ensure the initial inventory and subsequent inspections are 100% accurate and challenge everything that is not clear\/ a true representation in writing - if you don\\'t you will be disappointed at the end of your tenancy - luckily we kept extensive notes\/photos and fed them back to the letting agency.","572":null,"573":"Landlord was lovely did their best to solved problems as soon as possible.

I have had a door broken. No one bothered fixing it. The toilet seat was broken my entire tenancy. Yet no one fixed it for 8 months! It\u2019s ridiculous. DO NOT RENT THIS PROPERTY, unless you want a stressful time and have the energy to chase it up.","576":"The property is in an expensive area, so you don\\'t get much for your money. It has two bedrooms one bedroom is a decent size the other is quite small with a double bed in it. The living room was spacious and furniture that comes with the property in good condition. Kitchen was small, but because it open outs into the lounge it doesn\\'t matter too much. The bathroom has two doors, one into the main bedroom the other into the hallway. It\\'s a decent size but has no windows and a poor ventilation fan, giving us mould issues.\n\r\nThe letting agents were very keen to sign us up, but not very helpful once we had moved in.

The landlord is unable\/unwilling to work on this issue so it is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There are also moisture problems throughout the property, which six months into the tenancy have not been addressed. Other issues take an extremely long time to work on (e.g. three months to reattach a rusted-through shower head holster, 2 months to fix faulty flooring with nails sticking out).","578":null,"579":null,"580":null,"581":"do not recommend to rent this property at all. I have got the keys on 5th december and still living on my friend\\'s coach. first it took the landlord a month to sign the tenancy agreement.  the day i got the keys, both myself and the inventory company reported some issues with the washing machine, oven and myself about the toilet flush. this property is managed by foxtons and the landlord doesnt want any sort of interaction with the tenant. after approx. 3 weeks of non-stop calls and email they have arranged for the washing machine and the oven and cooker to be changed. on the delivery day the company couldn\\'t do nothing since they havent been informed the washing machine is filled with water although the landlord has sent her engineer twice in attempt to repair it. no correct measurement has been done and reported to the company for the oven and cooker and they didnt fit and there was a health and safety issue wit the cooker which needed to be changed to electric all together. so another day gone without any progress. the landlord is still not accepting the toilet flush is faulty although its been reported to the property management at the foxtons by myself treat the water doenst stop after flushing and she refuses to pay for any plumber fees to filter the water out of the washing machine. I have requested to be paid a compensation for the time i paid rent for the flat and couldn\\'t live in it and the landlord has refused to pay anything although she knows that i havent been able to live in the property. latest news i have received from foxtons is that they were trying to contact the landlord till the last minutes before christmas holidays to get permission to send their own plumber with their own costs but she didnt answer their calls. now its Christmas holidays and i have to spend at least another 2 weeks at my friend\\'s for everything to open again. please avoid this flat and this landlord by all means otherwise you will have the worst and the most miserable experience of your life.

Property is warm, double glazed and filled with pleasant housemates.","583":"Overall, the house offered a decent level of living. But only the living room had light during the morning hours, the bedroom and kitchen were hidden between houses and there was no light during day whatsoever. Because of this, the kitchen had constant mould and wet air - the agency sent someone to sort out the external (raining on the outside wall was a source of extra mould), but never sorted the interior (I\\'ve been told to buy dehumidifier if still an issue). The agency has a very helpful property manager, but because the landlord lives abroad no investment has been done to the house in years - everything looks, feels and smells old. After I left they reshaped the house (from 1 bed to 2 beds), which means the living standards went down (as they created a wall between the only source of light - living room - and the rest of the house). Also, the estate agents who rent the flat are completely unfair as an agency (very high fees; also, I\\'ve paid extra for furniture, but they provided super low quality products), so I would not recommend the agency or the property.","584":"I moved to this property as it a shared house. The 4 tenants 3 females and one male were nothing but nasty to me while living in the property. One girl banged on my door at 3 am accusing me of keeping her awake. I called the police as I was afraid for my safety as I only just moved in and was not sure what she was capable of. The police did not turn up at all they said if she disturbed me again to call them. I reported the incident to the agent and the agent who is a woman did nothing about it. All she did was agree I was making noise and dismissed my feelings I expressed to her that I felt afraid. She showed no remorse or anything. I told her I reported the tenant to the police. The next day the female tenant was complaining about me to the two female tenants. I could hear her repeating the things I said to the agent via email. Therefore the agent set the female tenant on me and does not know anything about confidentiality. \n\r\nThis female tenant the next day after called the police and told the police that I tried to stab her. I was so shocked and in disbelief. The police could work out the female tenant was lying that banged on my door at 3am and told her she was wrong. I told the agent in my email when I complained about the female tenant banging on my door for her to tell the tenant not to knock on my door again but the harassment continued. The other three tenants then started banging on my door. They made my life a living hell. \n\r\nAlso, 2 months after I moved in the agent threatened to send me a section 8 just because my ex called the cops to my house to accuse me of harassment (which was not true) it was my ex that couldn\\'t handle me breaking it off with him). The tenants are the ones that called the agent when the cops came the agent did not even listen to me why they came over. She made me feel so intimidated. \n\r\nI then had my mental health affected over the months because of the tenants and agent. I had to go to the council and get a Case Worker to contact the Landlord to investigate the agent and the tenants. But the Landlord did nothing they ignored my cries of suffering. I really believe the agent is biased and the tenants are racist. \n\r\nI went to court this July as the Landlord applied to court without notice to me and my solicitor and I was able to suspend the possession order. I have no job and can\\'t even move out so will have to see if the council now can step in to help me with permanent housing before I end up homeless. I don\\'t know what the outcome will be by the end of the month, but it is scary how people can get away with destroying your life and trying to character assassinate you.

Bathroom got completely flooded and was disgusting. The landlord personally came out to the property to deal with the situation. He brought his own towels and cleaning products to help so that I wasn\u2019t using my own to clean up the mess.

He will do the less when it comes to repair and is unfairly trying to claim my full deposit back. I just don\\'t think he is someone fair and square. The lack of assistance from the landlord was to say the least unimaginable. I asked so may times for small repairs that needed to be done but he just never cared. \n\r\nThe good think about the property is probably the view. The location isn\\'t great since its far from big supermarkets. Close to Queenspark though. I don\\'t think the price asked is worth it. I found cheaper bigger and better as I just moved somewhere else. The property is furnished, The bed is comfortable enough and the storage in the bedroom is big. The couch in the living room and the desk chair are horribly uncomfortable. They should be replaced, which I asked for so may times, but the landlords never agreed to that. Again, his lack of flexibility speaks for itself. \n\r\nWhen I moved in, the first night, there was a leak from the ceiling in the bedroom that stained my duvet! I could not use electricity during a couple of days for the leak to dry. It was cold and could not use the heater and I had to sleep in the living room. I have been reimbursed one night from the landlord.... a proof of his human kindness.  The leak stained the ceiling. The ceiling has never been painted during my two years at the property despite my numerous email to the letting agency that was Fox and Son while I was staying there. I suppose this will be fix at some point for the next tenant. The lack of response is again one fo those example of people not caring from both the agency and the lanlord. \n\r\nThere is a mould issue in the porch. This is due to humidity. it\\'s pretty bad. This has never been fixed. This is a building\/property issue. The isolation from the windows is not the best either and relates to the humidity issue.  \n\r\nThe bathroom has no ventilation system and no plug socket!!! The water pressure is not the best but manageable. The bathtub has a leak inside but the landlord never changed the piece that caused it because its just one expensive bit to change. This caused my bathtub to always have the side panel unfitted and open so the worker who used to come to do some maintenance work could do some sort of hack and access it fast. Again, things not done properly. This worker stopped working for the landlord as he had enough of being unreasonably  annoyed by him. \n\r\nThe apartment has carpet and that is ok but it will need some professional work to be cleaned. In terms of heat the heating works well. Electricity is fine. The plants come with the apartment you have to deal with them else the landlord will make you pay for them.  \n\r\nThe place is not that sunny but not that dark. I wanted more sun so this one was of the reason why I moved. It gets dark very fast as the apartment is not facing west. The kitchen has everything needed. \n\r\nBig moth INFESTATION during spring and summer. I never had moth before. They come specially when the weather gets warm. You can even see them in the hallway of the property. I think it\\'s a building issue. \n\r\nTHE WORST OF THIS PROPERTY:\n\r\nA DRUG LORD LIVES ON THE SECOND FLOOR. THIS WILL DISTURB YOUR NIGHTS AND TAKE YOUR SANITY AWAY. \n\r\nThe drug lord has people coming in and out all the time. We had to create a case with the police and the council to have notice of closure. But it seems he just repeats patterns. He will be quiet for a while and then it ss another go to the party. Noises during the night, fights, screams, strangers, blood, urine and needles in the staircase. I have seen girls having overdoses or being unconscious in the grass outside the property.  I had contacted the agency about it and got no answer what\\'s so ever from Fox and Sons or the landlord as they just didn\\'t care at all. If you need a quiet place to live, just don\\'t bother with this one and do yourself some good. \n\r\nI was paying 900 but the landlords raised the property to 925. That was also one of the reason why I moved. The property is worth 850 per month max really. I accepted it because I was desperate for a flat at that time. \n\r\nIf you have a car its a hit or miss for parking. The street is on a slope, narrow and  has traffic all day.

Because of the many households sharing the rubbish bins, plus the food waste from the restaurant, the bins are constantly overflowing with a terrible smell. I always have to hold my breathe when I go out of or come back into my apartment. The smell comes into your apartment in the Summer, and there are constantly 4-5 flies flying in at any time. The noise at this alley is also ridiculous, ranging from the pizza restaurant sawing wood for their wood burning oven (this lasts several hours), to the motorcycle coming in and out, to neighbours shouting and screaming in the middle of the night...

The gas meter is behind the parking area of other flats and you would need to jump down for about 2 meters to take the reading.

Liked the place so much that I ended up staying for two years. \n\r\nNever had any problems with plumbing, electricity or structure of the property, although slight mould build-up around the windows in the winter. Gas heating system was very efficient and kept the place nice and warm in the winter. \n\r\nApartment is well-lit throughout the day. Unfortunately this was occasionally an issue as no curtains\/curtain rails were provided and instead the flat comes with basic blinds that do little to block out the light when you are trying to sleep (more of an issue during summer months, naturally).\n\r\nWas not given induction by landlord, check-in was performed by a \u2018check-in agent\u2019 who, despite being friendly enough, did not know much about the flat or where anything was.  \n\r\nOn-street parking available, although spaces can be hard to find if arriving home late in the day. \n\r\nTraffic on road outside can be fairly loud and intrusive but if you\u2019re used to living in a city it probably will not bother you. \n\r\nOn very rare occasion that property has required repairs the landlord\u2019s agents were quick to send around their handy-man \u2013 a lovely bloke who prides himself on attention to detail \u2013 and as a result most issues were resolved very promptly (although on occasion the agent may need reminding)\n\r\nNeighbours are generally very friendly and quiet, although we were very rarely (<5 times in two years) disturbed by residents in the social housing block of flats a few doors down when they had parties\/domestic disputes. \n\r\nOnly real issue with the property is how thin the floors are \u2013 I lived alone as did my downstairs neighbour and as a result neither of us made that much noise. However, being an old, converted house, I could unfortunately hear much of what was going on downstairs e.g. talking, doors closing, even coughs and sneezes, and I don\u2019t doubt my neighbour would have been able to hear me upstairs too. If either property had particularly loud people living there I\u2019m sure this would significantly impact on the neighbour\u2019s enjoyment of their flat.  \n\r\nSadly in the last month of the tenancy I had an unexpected altercation with the landlord. Throughout the two-year tenancy the property had been managed by an \u2018agent\u2019 who, owing to them both having the same last name, was clearly the landlord\u2019s daughter. Throughout the tenancy she was fairly incompetent and unreliable but owing to the fact she was quite young and that she would, with enough prompting, get issues sorted eventually this did not pose too much of a problem. However at the end of the tenancy, when she began arranging viewings for prospective tenants, her lackadaisical approach meant that she invariable arranged viewings with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. This was not a big problem until, one weekend, she contacted me at 5:30pm on a Saturday to let me know she had booked no less than ten separate viewings for Sunday at 12pm. As I had friends coming over for a party I replied saying that this was not appropriate and that she should reschedule. The agent did not think to check her emails until 10:30 on the Sunday and when she did she became hysterical; she called me immediately and let loose with a torrent of abuse before alternating between threatening me with litigation and pleading to my better nature. When that did not move me, she went crying to her father, the landlord, who then called me and threatened to come to the property, let himself in and attack me unless I backed-down and let his daughter show the tenants around. Sadly, faced with the prospect of at best having to fight a middle-aged man, or at worst have to fight a lengthy court case to get my deposit back, I acquiesced and asked my friends to go down to the pub while the viewings went ahead. \n\r\nAs a result, as much as I enjoyed my time in the property I could never recommend renting anything from this pair of self-important sociopaths. If you do end up renting from them, be prepared to deal with a petulant and emotionally unstable child of an agent and a violent, unhinged landlord.","619":"Landlord is overseas investor so managed by a large property management company.

Mold is a real problem.\n\r\nThe floor carpets are filthy and very old.\n\r\nOn arrival there was no doorbell (essential for this property), no bathroom mirror or blinds on bathroom window.  All of these I had to buy and fit myself.\n\n\r\nThe landlord was very difficult to contact by phone, email or any other method.\n\r\nWhen there was no heating in February (resulting from a fault with the heater) she was at first almost impossible to contact.  Then very reluctant to engage with the problem at all.  Eventually it was over three weeks without heating before it was fixed.\n\r\nOn moving out of the property I asked if she would like me to leave behind the new wasing machine and desk I had brought to the property , for the next tenant to benefit from.  She agreed.\r\nHowever, after vacating she entirely changed her mind and requested that I remove these items \u2013 I chose to have the cost of this deducted from my returned deposit as I had by this time moved on and couldn\\'t personally deal with it.\n\r\nThis was symptomatic of the general unreliability of this landlord throughout my tenancy.\n\r\nThe Town however, (Totnes) and the general are is a charming place and with the right property and landlord it is a very pleasant place to live.","621":null,"622":null,"623":"I felt I was treated terribly and am glad to be gone.

There was a slight condensation in the biggest bed room and in the bathroom, but that was mainly due to lack of air circulation during the winter months which is common. \n\r\nThe property was in very good condition when we moved in and had no problems during the tenancy.

Gave us 1 hours notice that they would be coming to the property although they knew she was on night duty asleep. Rarely gave us 24 hours notice for appearence or would ignore our concerns all together. Shower broke and refused to replace it for a month and a half.

It is however in a poor condition that requires major renovation. The walls and the roof leak when it rains, which results in the mould forming inside. Despite this issue being fixed to some extent last year, it still persists. The kitchen is dated, fridge accumulates ice, furniture and the oven were damaged from first day we rented it, and it was never fixed. Also, there is a problem with spiders. There are hordes of them on the ground floor, as there are many uninsulated gaps and corners in the kitchen where they hide. The spider problem has never been addressed by the agency either, in spite of reporting.\r\nThe fuse box is also very old, sometimes causing problems with electricity.\r\nAlthough the landlord replaced most of old windows and initially absolutely unsecure and faulty doors, windows on the top floor are still the same, with one window being broken. It cannot be closed properly which causes drafts and occasional leakage.\r\nThe agency has been fairly responsive to reports but only to fix essential issues, such as clogged drains. It however took a long time and usually many reminders to get things fixed, e.g. it took four months to fix a leaking wall. \r\nIn the end of tenancy, the landlord claimed the entire deposit. While one charge was agreed upon, the rest were for repairs for damages that we did not make. Given that we bought many things for the house that we left there (vacuum cleaners, bookshelves, desks that were essential and improved its value), inventing reasons for deductions is absolutely repulsive.\r\nThe house has a lot of potential to become a really great place if renovated.

The flat itself was pretty bad. Single pane windows overlooking a very busy road. Lots of pubs nearby so drunken fighting was regular into late hours. Keeping warm was an issue. Damp and mould almost everywhere. But by far, the biggest problem with this property was the landlord, who is also the managing director of the letting agent office below. And these are the reasons why:\r\n1. A month after we moved in, they wrote to us (IMAGE #1) advising that they would obtain entry for an inspection between the hours of 1pm - 5pm on the 8th Jan 2015, and if they hadn\\'t heard from us to the contrary, would \\\"bring their set of keys\\\" in case we were not in. This clearly amounts to entry without consent. Agents were acting on behalf of landlord, who was also their boss.\r\n2. Having signed for a six-month fixed term, we were contacted by letter (IMAGE #2) and asked to confirm our intentions at the six month point. The relevant charges were all laid out, except one that had NOT been drawn to our attention prior to the signing of the tenancy. We had guarantors for whom we had to pay \u00a380+VAT x2 (credit checks) and we also had to pay \u00a380+VAT x2 for each of us as tenants (credit checks) - but landlord\/managing director ALSO sprung on us a further \u00a380+VAT for \\\"rent guarantee insurance to guarantee the rent.\\\" Which - as well as not being made aware of at start - is precisely what the guarantors do, and what we paid \u00a380+VAT x2 to accomplish..!\r\n3. Before we moved in, the landlord informed us that our gas bill was a shared bill...shared with the lettings office. They stated that they paid 60% of the bill and we had to pay 40%. They gave us NO further information. They way it was presented was misleading, because we thought we had struck a fair deal. But it was far from fair. When the first quarterly bill arrived (IMAGE #3), the landlord had calculated each percentage and dropped a note through the door demanding we pay \u00a3518 for three months gas (IMAGE #4). Although the flat was a six bedroom property, the top floor - consequently three rooms - had no heating at all. Not only that, but all hot water was done via the immersion heater - therefore, from our pre-paid electricity. What we found out, was that the bill - totalling \u00a31,296 - was in fact a business account bill which incurred a much higher rate of VAT. Not only were the office bound by Health and Safety Laws to keep the office space continually heated throughout the winter, but the rates were not the same as domestic gas use, and domestic gas would not have incurred the same VAT. This - I felt - was information which was not only absolutely crucial to the fundamental agreement to share the gas bill, but which had been withheld from us when making the agreement. The Property Ombudsman Codes of Practice in fact place a very strict requirement on agents to disclose all relevant information like this when making agreements. It has - arguably - the effect of rendering the term a Statutorily Unfair one. \r\nAs each of these issues occurred, I\\'d made a complaint. After complaining about the final matter - the gas bill - the landlord evicted us. She later claimed she evicted us because I\\'d been abusive. The Council found in her favour, and concluded we were \\\"intentionally homeless\\\" despite the utter lack of evidence from the landlord to substantiate her claims...In fact, all the letters and emails I supplied to the council clearly showed that the landlord evicted us as a direct result of my three complaints. \r\nI would never, ever recommend this place to ANYONE.","651":null,"652":null,"653":null,"654":null,"655":"Landlord barely responded to emails over two years let alone sent anyone to fix problems.

I don\\'t recall a single warm evening in the winter, despite that.\n\r\nSecond, the plumbing is very basic. The water system can supply only one tap\/toilet\/appliance at a time - so if you\\'re taking a shower, and the washing machine is on, or if someone fills the kettle, or runs a bathroom sink downstairs, brace for the water just to.... stop.

But this wasn\u2019t a huge problem for me. The problem is that they had they cheek to make the following deductions at the end of my tenancy, after I had spent all day making the apartment spotless:\n\r\n-\tx2 extractor bulbs - \u00a320 (Lights I never used\u2026)\r\n-\tmattress clean - \u00a335 (A mattress that had a mattress protector on it\u2026)\r\n-\tchair clean - \u00a335 (A chair that was dirty when I arrived and couldn\u2019t be properly cleaned\u2026)\n\r\nAfter emailing back and forth I managed to get out of the first two deductions but had to settle on paying for the chair clean (I doubt it was or ever will be cleaned). And that\u2019s not all. After spending the whole winter in that flat I noticed there were gaps in one of the windows. One between the window frame and the pane of glass, over 1cm (p.3). And the other between the two sliding window frames (p.4). These gaps were allowing cold air to fill the room and consequently I could hear every sound from outside. I had essentially wasted money on heating that went straight out the window: the one radiator in the studio was below the windows. My complaint about the window was not taken seriously by staff at X1 Lettings so I contacted Salford council instead. The council were very helpful and informed me that they deal with a lot of complaints about the apartments in this building. They presumably spoke with X1 Lettings, urging them to do something about it as it was immediately dealt with after the council\u2019s inspection. One of the gaps was sealed with silicone whilst the other one was not seen as a major problem, for some reason I cannot understand. I received no apology or reimbursement from X1 Lettings and gave up trying to fully resolve this issue. \n\r\nThe fact they allowed a tenant to move into a dirty flat with broken windows shows how negligent and unprofessional this rental agency is. Making unnecessary deductions from deposits further emphasises their greed and complete disregard for their tenants. If you are looking to rent with this agency, I would advise you to not rent an apartment in Town Hall. You will have problem after problem. The building is falling to bits and they have made a have hearted attempt to create rental apartments within this building. The apartments are cheap and nasty \u2013 inefficient heating, extreme condensation and mould (p.5). If you have a problem that needs fixed, it will be swept aside and never dealt with. I cannot speak for their other properties, but I would advise anyone to avoid renting with X1 Lettings. In my experience the staff are rude, dismissive and unsympathetic.","676":"Landlord has been quite.. inappropriate shall we say? This is a house share of 5 tenants. They share kitchen facilities only as the bedroom rooms are double en suites. \n\r\nHowever since then it\u2019s been a nightmare of a tenancy. This is a HMO (house of multiple occupancy). He is a live out landlord who lives 3 hours away in Birmingham . No property management company involved. He has a PA in the Philippines and one contracted handyman. \n\r\nA previous tenant didn\u2019t pay rent, he harassed him and the landlord asked tenants to spy on him, cut off his water supply, cut off his internet access  and join in harassing him, to which the tenants declined. He even asked one other tenant to open his mail (which the tenant declined!!). \n\r\n2) Builders kept turning up to paint rooms with zero notice, therefore disturbing the peace. Also he books viewings for other empty rooms with zero notice and people keep turning up to view with zero warning. \n\r\n3) One of the rings on the hob broke, the law states in a HMO 4 rings must work per 5 occupants. Reported it and it took over a month to be fixed. \n\r\n4) In October the water stopped working entirely for a day due to a broken pipe outside. Landlord was texted when it happened (sadly was at 10pm, but we couldn\u2019t shower, flush toilets or get a drink as shops were closed already) and the landlord was not sympathetic and just sent us dramatic texts like \u2018be thankful you don\u2019t have an infection people have it worse!!!\u2019. Luckily it got sorted the next morning. \n\r\n5) Landlord harasses female tenants. Asks them constantly out for dinner\/lunch dates and makes inappropriate comments about their appearance.\n\r\n6) The landlord keeps asking current tenants to take previous tenants items to the bin and the tip, but they\u2019re his legal responsibility.\n\r\n7) A letter came to all occupants stating a warrant was issued to search the property. The council turned up a few weeks later and said our landlord has no HMO licence, he applied 2.5 years ago and never continued with it, he\u2019s been on their radar for months. This is a criminal offence. \n\r\n8 ) When tenants move out he makes excuses to not pay the deposits back and the law states 10 days. Also sometimes he doesn\u2019t put some people\u2019s deposits in the deposit protection scheme (one person for 3 months!) and the law is 30 days! \n\r\nThe council advised all 5 of us tenants who were there at the time apply for a Rent Repayment Order to get up to a max of 12 months rent refunded due to the lack of HMO licence. They said as we have signed agreements and can prove we\u2019ve paid rent with bank statements, and our deposits are in the deposit scheme we will win hands down. They\u2019ve made it clear he\u2019s a rogue illegal landlord.","677":"We had no heating for two years house was full of mould on walls and floors leaks all over the place holes in the roof fungi growing windows falling out down stairs toilet fell over no washing facilities for 8 months \r\nOnly shower fixed after 8 months of it not working heating condemned never fixed","678":null,"679":null,"680":null,"681":null,"682":null,"683":null,"684":null,"685":null,"686":"Room rent.

It doesn\\'t look it, as the flat itself looked very nice, but this was the worst property we\\'ve ever lived in. What has made our stay there a living hell was the absent landlords and their incompetent property management agency. The landlords live in Australia and every maintenance request took long weeks to answer - and usually with a refusal or a perfunctory response. And we had to work hard for even this poor service, chasing and sending reminders. The management property simply ignore your e-mails. Unless the landlords were obliged to fix the issue by law (and you\\'d be surprised how narrow the list is - we\\'ve become an experts now), nothing got fixed. We moved into a flea-ridden property (from the previous tenants\\' cat) filled with building debris. We spent 5 nights in a hotel and had to force the landlords to eradicate the fleas. The hotel expenses and removal of debris were never reimbursed.  The entrance light took close to 18 weeks to fix, with the tenants having to chase the property management for a response. For 4 months we needed a torch to enter our home. The garden tap, the hob and cooker, the vents, the shutters, the windows (most broken or painted shut) and massive damp - were never fixed. The worst problem was severe damp, with black smelly mould growing in every room of the property - during our entire tenancy (pregnant and then with a newborn baby) this was not fixed at all. Beware - this was not evident in our viewings of the property.

Furniture in the main living space is also prone to mould if left against the outside wall.

The address was Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road, London SE23 3HN. The only reason I have put it as the address above is that my address doesn\\&#39;t come up on the postcode finder and I was advised to do this and clarify the details. I never dealt at all with Sure2Move - all of my dealings were directly with Landlord. My story of renting from Landlord is as follows. I moved into the Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road on 1st September 2008. While until recently we enjoyed a fairly amicable relationship, Landlord was historically been negligent about attending to structural repairs in the property. For example, within my first few months of moving in, I had occasion to complain Landlord to the council over his inaction in protecting the property against pigeon excrement. On the 26th October 2011 I first let him know about the damp issue. No action was taken on this till 2015; and while the damp in the main room was repaired (due to a faulty pipe on the outside of the property, for which the permission of Lewisham Council was needed), the wall is still exposed and as Lewisham Council pointed out when they came around on 19th February 2016, there were mould spores there. There also is clearly damp along the main alley-facing wall of the flat. In April 2014, renovation works started on Landlords\u2019s son\u2019s flat above. I did give Landlord permission at the time to store building materials in my courtyard, on the understanding that they would be gone by July. In June 2014, I told Landlord that I had witnessed rats in the backyard. It took until November 2014 for some of the rubbish to be cleared; however a good portion still remains in my courtyard to this day \u2013 a courtyard that is included in my contract. Between June 2015 \u2013 January 2016 I recorded leaving my keys with Landlord&#39;s handyman and so-called property manager  at least 20 times over a combined period of approximately 40 days, so he could repair the damp, clear the backyard, fix an exposed area around the boiler and latterly, arrange for the building to be re-spiked against pigeons (during the renovations some spikes had not been replaced). There are a number of texts between myself and Landlord and myself and Handyman to this end. At the end of October I informed Handyman that I had spoken to someone at Lewisham Council, and I intended involving them if action wasn\u2019t taken. No action was taken, so on December 4th 2015 I informed Landlord that I intended to get the council involved, to which he made it very clear that he was aggrieved. He has alleged since that he arranged for all these jobs to be done from January 6th; however I never received any notice for him to visit the property, or indeed any inkling that this was in hand. I was promised by his handyman  by phone that the back garden would be cleared and the pigeon spiking would be done by January 19th. This didn\u2019t happen, and I was subsequently promised that it would happen by January 26th. This also didn\u2019t happen On February 11th or 12th, I contacted the EHES team at Lewisham council and arrangements were made to come visit the property on the 19th February. On February 17th I let handyman know by phone that the council would be coming, and on February the 18th I left a voicemail asking to be kept informed. Later on the 18th February a Section 21 was in my postbox. I was emailed by landlord on the 19th February to let me know it was there. I did not reply and then was texted by him on the 22nd of February. I phoned him to let him know I needed more time to consider my options, and he seemed fine with me taking a week or so. On the 24th February I emailed him (email already with Lewisham Council). He replied on the 24th February offering a reasonable increase in rent to \u00a3750pcm (although a steep increase at 36%, I felt if the issues were dealt with in the flat it would be a price worth paying for the remaining months I intended to stay, due to immigrating in the autumn to Germany). I did not reply to him, but on the 25th February he texted me to tell me he was reconsidering his offer, as he didn\u2019t like the \u2018tone\u2019 of my email (which had been seen and approved by Lewisham Council as being reasonable and balanced - their take on it was that he was \\&#39;lucky\\&#39; that I was giving him such an easy way out of an illegal eviction). Later that day he texted me to say he rescinded his Section 21 but would be happy to rent it out to me at \u2018market\u2019 value (in his estimation, \u00a3900pcm \u2013 which is at least \u00a3100 over the market value of similar-sized properties in the area which are at a far higher maintenance level structurally). I emailed him back that day to say I would need professional advice and I would get back to him in a few days. Later that night, at 22.18pm, Landlord sent  me an email with his timeline overview, an assertion that I won\u2019t want to pay \u00a3900pcm and telling me he had found a room in a houseshare property for me in the area via Zoopla. At this juncture, I had already decided to re-visit SHIP Housing Options at Lewisham Council upon the advice of one of their call centre operatives, which I did the next day. To say that Landlord is increasingly erratic, harassing and intimidating emails and texts were stressful is to state the obvious. Moreover, his handyman  had a copy of the keys to my flat, which made me increasingly uncomfortable. Lewisham Council really tried to help me by mediating with landlord, but to no avail. They subsequently sent me an email trail in which he basically said he had been giving me a cheaper rent all these because he thought our relationship was \\&#39;more\\&#39; than landlord and tenant. He alluded to an episode of which I had made the council already aware of, whereby I missed a month\\&#39;s rent in 2011 due to financial hardship, and he told me to pay back only half when I had it - which I did. However this does not negate the fact that he was happy to rent out a substandard property for 5 years after, during which time his rubbish from building was stored in my courtyard, and I had to endure almost two years of building works in the property above. During that time my kitchen was flooded twice, and it was only due to a conscientious electrician that the lights in the kitchen were repaired. Recently when a BT operative came to inspect the wiring in the estate agents above which was apparently connected to mine (I had no idea about this in the almost 8 years I lived there) she made it clear that it was a hazard waiting to happen. It is clear that his sole intention is to harass me out of the property, by setting a rent that is a 64% increase on what I had been paying, and with no indication that he intends to do anything about the structural maintenance issues outstanding. It transpired that he may have some involvement in a property development happening close to the flat and that his intention was to use my flat as the site office. I was forced into a position whereby I felt I have no choice (for a number of factors, including my own personal safety) but to vacate the property by the end of April. Lewisham Council kindly stepped in to give him my notice, and it seems no coincidence that on the day they did that, one of his workmen jumped in over my wall \\&#39;to retrieve tools\\&#39;. I contacted Lewisham Council immediately and said to them if they felt it was appropriate to warn landlord that if he trespassed on my property at any point in time during the rest of my tenure, or harassed me in any way, that I would involve the police. I do not know whether that message was passed on. I left my property under duress and because (as it was explained to me by Lewisham Council) I was scuppered by the lack of regulation of private landlords which might have entailed me having to pay Landlord court costs. While I would have preferred a more amicable end to my time in the place I\u2019ve called home for the last almost 8 years, it became very clear to me now Landlord, despite his protestations to the contrary, has had never any intention of fulfilling his legal obligations as a landlord to maintain the property structurally except when it was absolutely unavoidable (as when my kitchen was flooded a number of times from upstairs). There was been a huge toll on my health, physically and mentally, both in terms of living in a property that is well below market maintenance and also in the energy expended in trying to get landlord to fulfil his obligations as a landlord. Landlord owns a number of properties in the area \u2013 some of them in a similar state of disrepair from what I\\&#39;ve seen \u2013 and in my experience of him as a landlord, he tends to rent out to those who might be considered vulnerable i.e. immigrants, women etc. My intention in writing this on Ask Tenants is so other potential tenants looking to rent in the Forest Hill area can avoid dealing with landlord at all costs. According to Lewisham Council, he is now on their watch list of rogue landlords. I have taken a number of video clips and would be happy to post them if useful.","758":null,"759":null,"760":null,"761":null,"762":"This area is lovely if a bit removed, the building is nice but the apartment is shabby around the edges.\r\nHowever, the main complaint is with the landlord who was:\r\n1) very slow to respond to any issues, often did so with a bad attitude\r\n2) refused to fix the damaged (potentially dangerous) flooring, which meant we\\'d get complaints about noise from downstairs\r\n3) took 6 weeks to replace the broken washing machine (suggesting we pay for the repair, when I\\'d only just moved in)\r\n4) refused to pay to fix the loo (which had needed repair before I moved in)\r\n5) kept promising to replace the broken sofas - this never happened\r\n6) put no blinds up in the kitchen\r\n7) wouldn\\'t fix the TV connection (therefore we had no TV)\r\n8) shared the dodgy wifi between ours and the flat he owned below, rendering it useless for streaming and unable to work from home\r\n9) had no temperature control, so the place is constantly boiling, even in summer and also means...\r\n10) there\\'s a lot of noise from the main road nearby from needing the windows open, which are single glazed anyway.\r\n11) doesn\\'t check flatmate references - one flatmate lied about what they did for a job, that they were a smoker and owned a dog which they would hardly ever walk - their replacement accused the other flatmate of being racist and intentionally left used tissues in the shared spaces when Covid happened.\r\n12) did not protect our deposit until we made him, which was then outside the 30 day required period.\n\r\nWould not recommend.","763":null,"764":null,"765":"Positives: Fabulous location - 5 min walk from high street, 10-min walk from tube station, 5-min walk from Richmond Park, opposite Ofsted-rated outstanding school & Petersham terrace gardens; large well-lit rooms with decent views; two toilet-bathrooms; landlord has maintenance contract with British Gas\n\r\nNegatives: Creaky floors; working shower in only one bathroom; limited space in kitchen; bathrooms & kitchen could do with a facelift","766":null,"767":"Landlord is absolutely awful - I really wouldn\u2019t recommend even thinking about living here.

This left the other tenants and myself without the ability to boil the kettle or to do a load of washing without tripping the fuze. Obviously this was very inconvenient. While I was living there, at least 4 different \\&#34;repair men\\&#34; came to fix the problem (Some of them even came without any Tools). This went on for at least 3 months (from 31.12.2015 till 5.4.2016) and the problem was still there when I left. \n\r\nThe shower pump also had stopped working so the pressure in the shower was depressing. This problem took around 2 months to fix. I would ask for an update on the progress once a week or so - this request usually seemed to be ignored. Her daughter was living in the house too in the upstairs room. She took on the task of spying on myself and the other lodgers, reporting to landlady when we had guests stay overnight which I was only aware of after Landlady decided to with-hold part of my deposit of \u00a350 per week for an extra guest. This amount was never discussed or mentioned previously. I had also had a discussion with her before taking the room about my girlfriend being able to stay occasionally (who was my only guest) as we lived in separate countries. She of course was fine with this arrangement on an \\&#34;occasional\\&#34; basis but still decided to withhold \u00a385 of my deposit. She also decided to charge me \u00a320 for some damage to the fridge seal. (Which the photos I took on vacating the flat on my last day show no damage). To this day I have not seen a receipt for the repair or evidence of the damage itself, she simply decided to keep my money. \n\r\nDuring my stay there, landlady had gone for a holiday to the Caribbean for several months and she only arrived back to London after I left the property. This was fine but she was impossible to contact 99% of the time. Each time I needed to contact her about something, I would text her and email her and also give her a call (which she very rarely picked up her phone) to make sure she knew I was trying to contact her and to please get back to me. Weeks would go by and nothing so much as a simple txt saying &#34;I&#39;ll get back to you soon&#34; was received. Just complete ignorance. I would send a follow up message, text and call her and leave a voicemail. Again this was ignored time and time again. \n\r\nHer daughter was of a similar attitude, as she took responsibility for &#34;Handling&#34; the repairs to the property - when I was unable to get a response from landlady, I sent her a txt asking for a simple update about the repairs so that I can know that something is actually being done about it. (My messages were always courteous and professional). She replied to my txt soon after: &#34;contact your landlord, im not your landlord&#34;. It was clear from then that she was not interested in being at all helpful. My main issue with this property and landlord is not that repairs weren&#39;t attended to in a timely manner or even that landlady took my deposit. Landlady and her daughter were just plain ignorant. Landlady clearly had no interest in managing the property, it has become apparent that she just wanted to take as much money as possible from her lodgers while putting in the least amount of effort. After landlady sent me an email advising that she was withholding some of my deposit, I sent her a professionally drafted email requesting a receipt for the repair and to discuss the amounts she had decided to withhold. This email was also ignored and I have not received any reply in weeks. \n\r\nDon&#39;t move in here and avoid this property all together. Good luck finding a nice place, there are good spots and good landlords out there, I just know it! :)","769":"The ceiling leaks during heavy rain. The property is spacious and very well furnished. The energy consumption is very high for heating as the 2 of 3 windows are not useful to keep away cold. The whole building doesn\\'t have lift, as the landlord assures lift will start soon and its been years now. The entrance is unguarded and you can lose your deliveries and postal letters. The building has been fitted with modern fire alarm system. No parking permits issued for the building from council as this is car free property. The entrance to the property is unsafe during late night sometimes because of some antisocial behaviours.","770":"The property is modern and bright. The bathrooms and kitchens are fairly new and modern. However, there are mould issues. One of the bedrooms has mould all around the skirting and in the wardrobe. As a result, personal possessions are completely destroyed by mould. The landlord painted everything in anti-mould paint but the mould still came back. The bedroom really smells of damp so I think it\\'s an issue within the building. There is also mould in the bathroom and actual mushrooms grew through the grout! The handyman believed there was a leak in the upstairs flat which caused all of this (as you could often hear water running down the internal wall) but he never investigated it.\n\r\nThe flooring is quite poor and coming up in places. The kitchen has been designed very badly and has very little space to store anything.\n\r\nIt\\'s a shame because it could be a nice flat but the upkeep is really neglected and mould issues are not taken seriously.\n\r\nSome of the neighbours smoke a lot of weed constantly and the smell can come into the flat too which is frustrating.\n\r\nThere is a bus stop right outside which can be very loud. This also leads to lots of rubbish accumulating around the front of the property\/front door step. Even though the landlord owns the whole block, as far I\\'m aware he doesn\\'t organise for this to be cleaned and individual tenants have to clean it.\n\r\nThe landlord is not good. I raised the issues of mould multiple times and his only solution was to paint over everything in anti-mould paint rather than address the root cause.\n\r\nWhen the handyman visited he said he thought there may be a leak upstairs which caused the mould, as you could hear water running down the wall. He kept saying he would investigate this but never did.\n\r\nWhen I left, I asked the landlord for compensation as so many of my possessions had been ruined by mould. He essentially said the mould was my fault for not airing the room properly so he would not be compensating me. The issue is that the room has been fitted with vents on the outside walls and the wardrobe doors which suggests to me that this has always been an issue, otherwise they would not have been installed. My flatmate also informed me that the previous tenant had issues with mould too. The room was as well ventilated as it could be given that it was a ground floor, front-facing room on a busy road in London, so the windows couldn\\'t be constantly open for safety reasons - I\\'m not too sure what the landlord expects tenants to do. I also had the extractor fan on for hours after I had a shower, but the handyman told the landlord that he visited the property and I didn\\'t have it on. It seemed to me that they were all working together to cover up the mould issue because they couldn\\'t be bothered to find the cause.\n\r\nCommunication is also incredibly poor. We communicated with the landlord via his secretary who was unhelpful. She doesn\\'t reply to emails unless you send multiple follow up emails and call her.\n\r\nWe would often communicate directly with the handymen when we needed something fixed, due to the secretary not replying. They couldn\\'t commit to which days they would visit, often 3 days later than initially agreed and acted with no urgency when we had serious issues.\n\r\nWhen you leave the property, the landlord doesn\\'t pay you back the deposit directly and you have to wait for the new tenant to pay you. They don\\'t ask the new tenant to pay you as soon as possible so you can be left waiting for ages after you\\'ve moved out for them to pay you. This could be resolved by the landlord managing the deposit better.","771":"The main issue we have undergone was that our landlord entered our house several times when we were absent without notifying us in advance. He was also very aggressive on several occasions when we have had disagreements, especially with my flatmate.\r\nAnother serious issue we have had was that the flat was very cold throughout the whole winter, we complained many times, but nothing was done. The bills were included in our rent and we offered to pay more if he were to raise the heat, but he did not.\r\nThere was a leak in my room as I was away, it stained the walls, my bedsheets, etc,... and nothing was done. He even reproached me for the stain on the wall when I handed in the keys.\r\nWe live in the basement of the house, and there are people living upstairs. Their kitchen was above my room and the noise was a nuisance all year around, there is no insulation whatsoever. The worst was the washing machine that was often on late at night.\r\nThere are a lot of spiders around the house, and from the scratching noises we hear at night, we believe that it is likely that there are rats upstairs.\r\nWhen we handed in the keys, he threatened us with taking part of our deposit back fr things that were already damaged when we first entered the flat.\r\nThere is also a huge problem with waste management in the neighborhood. There is litter on the floor constantly.\r\nOther than that, the area is close to the university (30 minutes walking), Asda, the curry mile. The bathroom has been refurbished recently.","772":"The landlord was more than happy to take our rent but took him nearly 6 months to remedy a leak from our bathroom down through to the kitchen ceiling. This led to severe mould. We dealt with a bee infestation near the roof that the landlord initially refused to reimburse us for.\n\r\nHe refused to fix the front broken gate and we constantly had to make our own repairs around the property due to it being so poorly maintained by the landlord. At the end of the tenancy the tenancy agency strongly advised the landlord to put in new carpets, but the landlord refused. He even had the audacity to take money out of our deposit for cleaning and repairs, despite us spending three days cleaning the property. \n\r\nIt seems that some people have no pride or care for their property.","773":null,"774":null,"775":"Landlord (Abode) will threaten violence when tenants raise any issue with the property. Thermostat was broken before we moved in which took an entire winter season to fix. As a result of this, mould and damp occurred in every room which was never corrected (one room was changed so that the wardrobe was covering a serious patch of damp\/mould prior to a potential new tenant viewing). We were also blamed for the thermostat being broken despite it being an issue since before we moved in. Landlord takes days to respond to messages about the house, then will not take action unless prompted multiple times, when we are met with verbal aggression.

It started as a problem in the first six months of our tenancy and NEVER FIXED. To add to the problem the landlord blamed my family for it.

The landlord actually assured me, to my face, that I would not be charged for this. Apparently honesty means nothing?\r\nThe other charge that is absurd is that the door handle was broken the entire time I lived there, and after reporting it multiple times, was never fixed. The landlord came to fix it once, but basically she put it back on, without fixing the problem. So it slid off again immediately. I reported this again and nothing was done about it.

We had to constantly chase the landlord for things to be resolved and fixed, getting sporadic and often rude replies. It never felt like there was any genuine care for the property or us as tenants. \r\nI would strongly warn against renting this property, even if the flat Is done up to a higher standard in the future the attitude from the landlord and property manager will remain the same, and I can safely say, it is not worth the stress, hostility or difficulty. And certainly not worth the rent you will pay.","818":"In general, this was a stress free tenancy. The gas and electric are inexpensive - below average quote by electricity provider - and the location is nice and safe. Kept getting the smell of cannabis from potty neighbours though. The boiler kept having issues that meant I needed to manually reset the pressure using a valve underneath it. I started doing this myself after some unfortunate gas man was called out in the wee hours to do this, which takes one minute. In the final months, the kitchen started to show its age, and shelves began to collapse while drawers fell to pieces. Complaints to landlord yielded only a visit to assess the problem, but I imagine this should have been fixed now we have moved out. An out of order drier remained on the property for the entire tenancy, despite complaints and requests to dispose of it, as we didn\\'t need it anyway. That said, the landlord repaired radiator issues and replaced a washing machine quickly, and our deposit was also quickly returned.","819":null,"820":null,"821":null,"822":null,"823":"The agency - flats4london - is the worst I have used in my now 7 years in London. They were incredibly unprofessional and rude, and I might add bordering on criminal. Please stay away from this agency at all costs.","824":"We were hugely disappointed with the landlords behaviour and management of the property throughout the tenancy. They remained in breach of our tenancy agreement from day 1 and never made any real efforts to change that. We continually raised issues within the flat i.e. mice, broken dishwasher, suspected damp (raised in fact by another landlord in the building), curtains that didn\\'t close, mis-wired elections, broken hob, back doors and windows that did not shut properly leading to security issues and concerns over valid insurance - to name a few. In addition the landlords tried to have the property valued and put on the market without our knowledge by instructing sales negotiators to say they were \\'surveyors\\' helping the landlord re-mortgage. They then proceeded to agree to only have it on the market for 2-3 months and in fact kept in on for nearly 5 months without engaging with us at all, an on one occasion sending quite rude emails in response to our obvious distress at the situation.","825":"The letting agency has been ok, I guess average with their ups and downs (especially some problems around arranging viewings when we were leaving). However the management of the place is done directly by the landlord who takes a lot of care of the property and is very responsive and wants to keep the place in top condition, so our overall experience was unusually good. I moved away because of a long commute, but if I worked in the area I\\'d go back without hesitation","826":"This property is a room to let with a live-in landlord. On viewing the property, all seemed tidy and he seemed pretty decent. \n\r\nOn moving in, I discovered that the boiler \/ heating system was faulty - ie there is no hot water on unless the heating is on full blast - the wheezy water tank is in my room. Landlord is aware of this and refuses to fix the issue.\n\r\nHe also claims he has the boiler serviced and annual safety inspections done - but is unable to provide evidence.\n\r\nThere is also regular leaking of water from the bathroom into the electrics into the ceiling below - again, the landlord refuses to fix this and claims this is NOT a safety issue as it doesnt leak all the time and that their is no risk of an electrical fire if water gets into the wiring as it will self-regulate.\r\nFurther, the landlord lives like a pig in a sty - his washing, dishes, DIY goods, childs toys, empty bottles, beer cans and other clutter litter the house everywhere - there is NO access to the communal areas ie dining table and lounge as these are filled with his junk. \n\r\nIssues have also included the kitchen tap breaking - as he was going away, he refused to fix it and for a week there was no running water in the kitchen - even for a few days after he was back - he would go to the garden and get water out the hose tap to fill the kettle!\n\r\nWhen he has massive binge drinking sessions, he and his friends are out in the garden all night - weeing all over the paving, being sick in the kitchen sink - this too is not cleaned for days.\n\r\nOther pleasant habits of his include having loud sex with his girlfiend with his door wide open, enjoying \\\"himself\\\" - again with the door wide open to his room - its cringeworthy!\n\r\nHe has also had endless issues with the poor old lady next door - they share a chimney breast which was on the verge of collape. The poor old lady was so worried however my landlord REFUSED to pay his share of the costs and REFUSED to admit it needed to be replaced and had this poor lady stressing for months until he finally agreed to pay the costs he is obliged to.\n\r\nThe garden is a hazardous construction site - wood and nails and rubble debris everywhere.\r\nI have tried raising the issue with him, and said that I am paying rent for a property and it needs to be clean and that he has basic legal responsibilities - he has said he does not, and that I rent a room and that its HIS HOUSE and he will do what he wants.\n\r\nI am a female - he also regularly wanders around the house in his underwear or no clothes at all.\n\r\nAs for his bathroom habits - he leaves his shavings everywhere, has no idea how to clean mould off the walls, leaves globs of toothepaste spit in the sink, wees all over the floor when he is drunk, leaves his marks down the loo bowl - I have to spray with bleach and disinfect after he showers - its FILTHY!\n\r\nA bonus point - despite the dangerous boiler and electrics - there are no working smoke alarms or carbon monoxide testers in the house. Landlord deems these unnecessary too. \n\r\nI honestly dont know of any living or dead creature that would or should live here.\n\r\nWorst bit is he has a 6 year old daughter who visits and creates more mess - and who at the age of  is still sleeping in bed with dad. He is often very drunk or hungover and sleeps away on the sofa while she is left to her own devices - eventually the poor kid climbs on him and I find them there on the sofa the next day. Its very sad.","827":"House has many issues, landlord only after making easy money not in sorting any issues out. House has no ventilation, not in bathroom nor kitchen so mould is a massive issue. Rising damp as well plus roof issues mean it\\'s not healthy to live in. Carpets are old and stain easily, decor is also old and poor. Bathroom is dated and taps often seize and not work or leak.House next door is a home for adults with mental problems so often hear screaming, shouting etc","828":null,"829":"DO NOT RENT!!!\r\nThe flat itself is nice, bright, looking smart living room\/kitchen. I had leaks issues (which happens).\r\nThe big problem I had was the bathroom ceiling collapsed following a leak.\r\nThe landlord reaction was dreadful. First I didn\\'t know if it would collapse even more so asked for temporary rehousing in an hotel which the landlord refused leaving me in an USAFE property. Only 5 days later a builder inspected the damages saying it was not going to collapsed any further.\r\nIt took a month to have the ceiling repaired by the insurance and the landlord refused to give me a discount for the inconvenience to have a broken ceiling.\r\nThe deposit : the landlord refuses to refund me \u00a3375 of my deposits saying it isn\\'t clean enough (I spent an afternoon with a friend cleaning the whole flat) and he isn\\'t providing any bills to justify these costs. I am about to start a dispute process obviously.\r\nThe flat is great, the location is great for commuting in central London but it\\'s not worth dealing with the current landlord.","830":"Very bad maintainace issues","831":null,"832":"Bed sit under 104,104 a still has a exesive damp problem the landlord tryed to fix the problem cheaply the damp has returned and always will \r\nThis is a converson under the house the property has no extracter fan hence the shower adds to the problem of damp","833":"Our landlords lied to us about a few things that they promised, and Spencer & Leigh let it happen. \n\r\n1. Our landlord said our electricity bill will be near nothing due to the fact that there are solar panels. However, once we moved in, we then found out that none if the power the solar panels generate goes into our electricity bills, instead they go into our landlords\u2019 bank accounts, and of course we don\u2019t get any discounts on our electricity bills.\n\r\n2. Before moving in, our landlords said they wanted to save having to get rid of some old furniture (sofa, chairs, beds, chests of drawers), so asked if we would use them, if so they can leave them here. But if we ever want to get rid of them and get our own furniture because they were quite old, then we can do so. So we agreed because it saved them having to spend money and effort, and we didn\u2019t mind having them in our home temporarily. However, they now said that they want everything they left behind to be here in perfect conditions. \n\r\nDuring Covid, when most landlords have given help to tenants, reducing rent, delaying rent or even canceling rent, we did not receive any help, nor did we even asked for it. And when it comes to us asking if we can have a 5-month contract or a rolling contract for 5 months after being here for two years and not missing one rent, they refused to do so and chose to kick us out early. We asked to have a 5-month contract rather than 6-month contract because we are moving to another country, and now we are left in a very difficult situation because we don\u2019t know where we can go after the date they wanted us out and before we move. We even asked if we can just leave two weeks after the date and they still refused to.\n\r\nThere are also many other moments when we felt that we were forced by our landlords and Spencer & Leigh to do certain things which are totally unfair, and felt that we were not treated with any respect.","834":"The letting agent is the owner of the house. The tenancy is done via his letting agency to earn him letting fees. It\\'s a terraced house that is converted into 2 studios on the ground floor, a 1 bedroom flat on the first floor and studio in the garden. I lived on the ground floor road facing studio. Curtains need to be closed at all times as people on the road can look right into your flat. Bills are included in the rent except internet. The boiler is placed in the communal area and is locked. The landlord keeps the key and heating is controlled by a timer. The heating is switched on during GMT for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening. I had to buy my own heater without the landlord knowledge as the house tends to be a cold storage and the landlord refuses to turn on the heating for longer hours. There is lots of damp and mould. The landlord refuses to treat the damp but just paints over the damp when new tenants move in. I had to buy a dehumidifier as the landlord did not see an issue. Mice get in from below the kitchen sink. Fortunately, there was a door to close the cupboard so the mice doesn\\'t get out. Can\\'t keep any food inside as mice would eat it. The landlord adds foam to the hole but the mice chew through the foam and he refuses to block the hole. The front and back yards are garbage dumps. The oven did not work when we moved in. The landlord replaced the cooker with another old cooker from another property after 10 months of begging.","835":"There was no mobile reception hence the reason to have left the property. Parking issue with onsite caretaker who insisted only the residents car had to be parked in their own allocated place even if the resident gave permission for any car to be parked was the worst experience of living at the property.","836":null,"837":null,"838":null,"839":"Landlords live next door, any requests for repairs and the landlords wife will threaten you with eviction.

There is a big problem with the deposit. The house looks better now than we rented it. We repainted the walls, cleaned up, changed old dirty wallpapers, repaired a leaking roof!

As a result, a fault on the electric boiler (which ran the heat and hot water) escalated to the point where the hearing was non functional, and leaks in the washing machine and shower went unrepaired for months at a time causing water damage and recurring mould.

Faulty electrics, causing surges and light bulbs to pop out. This house would be a major head ache to anyone moving in to it! Please don\\'t! And avoid the letting agent all together!","856":null,"857":"Signing up and Check-in process\r\nThe Good - The viewing process was easy and uncomplicated with the agent being able to answer any questions we had. Similarly in terms of signing the documents and providing proof of ID this again was quite seamless. Phone calls from your end were prompt and informed. We appreciated this. Terry\u2019s work putting up pictures \/ hooks etc was also well received. \r\nAreas where we felt let down \u2013 The Referencing agent you chose, KeySafe Ltd. KeySafe provide no tenant contact details, charge large fees and, in our experience did little to help tenants move through the referencing process. We provided details of referees to KeySafe who told us no-one answered when they emailed, this despite my being in the office of my previous letting agent when KeySafe stated they had sent the email. We faced long waits for this process, and in all honesty felt like we paid several hundred pounds to do our own referencing.  Note KeySafe did not reply to my repeated attempts to discuss this with them, and the Financial Ombudsman lodged it as a cause for concern. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re still using them, but if you are, I would recommend you consider whether they are providing just a service for yourselves to the detriment of tenant experience. \r\nLiving in the Cargo\r\nThe Good \u2013 Quiet, warm and well insulated with nice fittings and always clean in communal areas. The Gym is a nice facility, and the lounge looks inviting if a little quiet. The courtyard is well kept.\r\nAreas for development \u2013 The lift in building 2 on the left was broken for a significant period of time, often with little apparent haste to get it repaired. Once it was working, it then broke again shortly after. Recent times have been better, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating when I say 6 weeks of no lift was a little more than inconvenient. \r\nA little niggle, but one none-the-less, the post-boxes are in the wrong entrance i.e. ours was in the right-hand side set, when we live in the left hand set. Such a simple thing to rectify and would make a difference to lots of tenants. \r\nThe smell on level -1 in the left lift in building 2. Despite this being reported multiple times, a strong smell still lingers there, more so than in other areas. Clearly a bin accident has occurred, but it hasn\u2019t felt like a priority to fix it.\r\nCargo Staff and Reception\r\nThe Good \u2013 All the reception and concierge team are friendly, polite and professional and have a good relationship with residents. Parcels are taken and noted down which is really helpful and they always offer to pass on messages promptly. \r\nThe Not so good \u2013 I wrote to you regarding the issues with meter reads, and you were appropriate in responding to those issues with a reasonable plan for this. Unfortunately, of the following 4 times I have asked for meter reads, only 2 have arrived within the agreed time frame, once it was forgotten, and once I had to chase it via the management. Perhaps an alternative solution might a resident\u2019s online portal where you can Ask for Meter Reads with a log of the time of the request and the time it was provided, Get notified when a Parcel Arrives, and Submit Questions to the concierge team? It wouldn\u2019t be technically difficult but would provide a useful means of corresponding\r\nThe Renewal Process\r\nThe renewal process, as you are a commercial organisation, I was suppose always going to lead to an increase in rent, however I remain of the opinion that residents have not really had any quantifiable increase in value since the increase. The adaptations to the gym offers a reasonable added space, however at the cost cumulatively to the building\u2019s residents I\u2019m not sure it justifies the \u00a31.92\/resident\/week increase. Nevertheless, one has to put a price on convenience of staying, and once the niggles of the previous 12 months were ironed out, the process moved on.\r\nI would note once again the signing of documents, adjusted rent calculations and general speed of this process was not overly-impressive, requiring me to proactively chase the team to ask where things were up to, carrying on living in the apartment without a new contract for a significant time period, which puts both your organisation and ourselves in difficult legal situation. However, once the time came, and after my writing to you about the meter reads, a calculation of rent was provided promptly.\r\nThe Tone of Communications\r\nThe Good - The Cargo offers many communications to residents over the year, from seasonal events like the Pumpkin carving, to updates about parcels now and then. Generally the emails and tone from the Reception guys is friendly and amicable. These events and activities are nice opportunities for residents to get to know each other and I\u2019ve met a number of residents through these. The reception team are always friendly and helpful when you need them. Again, we appreciated this. \r\nAreas of development \u2013 I am again remembering that you are, inevitably, a commercial organisation first, and resident support team second, who need to ensure that rents are paid, income is maintained and revenue maximised. Recently, I feel that there\u2019s been a slight culture change in the tone of your emails:\r\n-\tAnyone not holding a valid car parking permit will have access restricted\r\n-\tWill be asked to pay retrospective charges\r\n-\tAny residents leaving trays in the corridor will be charged\r\nI also walked past a car with a note on the windscreen highlighting \u201cillegal parking\u201d parked on the front courtyard. I appreciate this must be an issue for you since the barriers have to be down now, however I would be careful about using the term \u201cillegal parking\u201d as, if anything, it would be a civil offence, and even then, until you acquire either both a BPA and IPC license, you would not be in a position to enforce this.\r\nI appreciate your requests in all these area stem from genuine issues, be it car parking issues, Tesco trolleys in the corridor, or rubbish in the lifts, however the tone, as a resident, is that of \u201cdo as we say or you will be financially penalised\u201d. We all know that re-enforcement does not work nearly as well positive. Furthermore, in any well-functioning organisation, issues like this are seen as opportunities to learn, so for example one might just fine a motorist, or they might ask why is that person parking there, is it because they can\u2019t get access to the car park, are they a visitor who you have clarified are not allowed to park, or is there another reason. Rather than resorting to charging your residents, perhaps try and think more about why these issues occur, and try to mitigate these reasons.\r\nMoving Out\r\nAgain, you are a commercial organisation, and your interests, at the end of the day, are to protect the Landlord\u2019s investment. To that end, it came as no surprise that you levied inappropriate charge. At the commencement of our tenancy, you advised that if we used Terry to put up decorations, that this would not involve a charge, however, predictably you reneged on this at the end of the tenancy, and charged a \u201cnominal\u201d amount for this. As promised, this will be communicated on public platforms for other tenants to see. \r\nFinal Comments\r\nLiving in a new flat, with a great view and location has been amazing, and for city centre living, the Cargo genuinely offers a premium option. Day to day cargo residence is convenient and pain-free, with most issues quickly resolved by friendly and approachable staff. I would recommend living here to anyone. \r\nI would implore all those who take out tenancies to take lots of photos when they move in, get any verbal commitments agreed in writing and ensure that concerns are escalated early. \r\nThank you for an enjoyable tenancy, and I wish you all the best for the future.","858":"Negatives\r\nIntercom does not work and does not look like it will ever be fixed, so not ideal if you buy stuff online.\n\r\nMice infestation on the 1st floor flats, blocked all the holes, now it\\'s the problem of all 1st floor residents.\n\r\nPositives\r\nInclude own parking bay with permit.\n\r\nModern looking inside interiors.","859":null,"860":"About two weeks in the landlord was informed of excessive mold and heating issues.

This whole experience was frustrating.

Perhaps because of the market and the food waste that was left there, we became absolutely infested with mice. The landlord helped a bit because he was worried they would spread into his cafe which was below the maisonette, but mostly we had to deal with this ourselves.\n\r\nOtherwise, the property was pretty good. Property was in alright condition, fully furnished with comfy  furniture. No living room (for five people) and kitchen was tiny, not enough space for all people to sit in or use all at once. There was a second kitchen in one of the bedrooms. Landlord was usually helpful for minor repairs, but had a tendency to enter the property randomly without asking in order to access the roof of his cafe. He was amicable, except when pressed on water\/mouse issues. No contact was ever made with managing agents (Black Katz) after signing the contract. Deposit returned smoothly. Area is very good, being in central angel meant almost anything was in 2-5 mins walking distance (shops, supermarkets, northern line, cinema, night clubs, pubs, etc).","868":"Old Fire Stations Apartments - do not rent at this property!

He own houses from 34 to 52 turner avenue.","873":null,"874":"The house was very cold and humid and the landlords didn\\'t let us use the heating. They put a timer for a few sporadic moments during the day which didn\\'t give enough time to the house to heat up.\r\nWe tried to contact the council but didn\\'t have much luck, the house temperature in the winter month was always around 15\u00b0, way below what the law says and if we tried to turn the heat on the landlords would call us angrily.","875":"The house was breaking down constantly. Once the shower handle broke and wouldn\u2019t close the flow of water. The handle itself was over 15 years old and was not even in production anymore! Nevertheless, the landlord tried to blame the break on the tenant. The ceiling in the cupboard of the room caved in and the landlord didn\u2019t do anything about it. Absolutely minimum effort on the landlord side unless it meant her getting more money. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone!","876":null,"877":null,"878":"The landlord for this property is excellent and fixes problems straight away.

I noticed it during my first night there and emailed the agency straight away. Unfortunately, I paid 6 months in advance (as I am self-employed and it seemed easier that way.. I guess, lessons learned). \n\r\nThe agency and the landlord were very uncompromising. I was surprised at how little sympathy I had from them. I have emailed them asking to release me from the contract or to call an engineer to look for a solution, but had very little help. My GP sent them a letter saying that the vibrations were causing my headaches, but still no response. I installed the app that was measuring the vibrations and sent the results to the agency, but unfortunately, they ignored it. The engineer\\'s fee was over a thousand pounds which I was happy to pay but they needed to lift the carpets and the agency\/landlord didn\\'t allow it.  \n\r\nThey arranged a few viewings (after 4 months of weekly correspondence with them) and kept saying that they are being very generous to me. However, nothing ever came out of those viewings. Only after 6 months when I left, they waited for a month (so that they could use my deposit) and then found new tenants. \n\r\nThe agency is called - Mountgrange heritage Kensington branch. \n\r\nThe neighborhood is nice and the bedroom is facing private gardens. Unfortunately, the flat needs work to address this issue. I hope this review saves someone from the situation I was in with this flat.\n\r\nP.S. On top of that, there were also mice in the flat. But this is minor in comparison to sleepless nights from the trembling bed and window frames.","881":null,"882":"Rats. Black mould. Damp. High crime.

Landlord can be really rigid.","889":"We rented this property last year while expecting our second child. Initially the landlord and the agents at CKD were very enthusiastic, showing us the property, showing us the heating system and how the landlord had designed the whole house himself. \n\r\nWe snapped up the property as its beautiful. Once we moved in we realised things were not going to be very good for us. For starters, the heating system in the property is not adiquate for the size of the property so unless we used convector heaters the house never got higher than 18 Degrees. Then our dishwasher broke. Rather than having an expert come and fit it the landlord Peter Shepheard asked if I would help him fit it so that he could save costs. We spent nearly an entire day trying to fit a dishwasher. We eventually did it with a dodgy fitted door. But anyway - it worked so yay!\n\r\nThe landlord would pop round the property a few times a week without notice to inspect the garden, he beloved apple tree hes growing (which we were told not to touch  as he would deal with it - in our home!). On multiple occassions he let himself into the property while my partner was home with our children. Totally unacceptable behaviour.\n\r\nThe garage door was poorly fitted on build and we noticed it was getting to a point it may fall from the garage roof. As I was parking my new Mercedes in the garage I was very concerned about this so asked the landlord to have it fixed. Guess what? Thats right - no professional, just Peter, A Drill and some screws. The results were loads of screws drilled into the garage roof to support the door. A very untidy and unprofessional job and I was not happy parking my car in the garage any longer.\n\r\nWe gave our notice to the property sighting issues with broadband (yes its terrible) and the landlord tried his very best to make us stay - even by withholding a reference for 2 weeks!. As soon as we did take on a new property Peter\\'s attitude changed. He became very needy by email - writing to me sometimes 5 times per day demanding access to the property. He also emailed us multiple times a day demanding we surrender the lease early as he has a new renter lined up. \n\r\nIn the end I had to issue him with a demand to stop contacting me or face Criminal Harassment charges. He backed off and never spoke to us again.\n\r\nMy advice? Stay well away from this property unless your happy with a meddling old man popping round to make sure your looking after his show home. There are nicer and more efficient properties available for that sort of money.","890":null,"891":null,"892":"They deducted \u00a3100 from the deposit as they argued the microwave was not in good condition whilst it was left in the very same condition (although fair use would be expected anyway). when I asked for the allegedly \\\"damaged\\\" microwave they said they got rid of it straight away so could not give it to me.","893":null,"894":"Could be a nice house very spacious and large garden. Nice neighbors. Drive is lovely and big. Massive problem with the house is mould and damp. Clearly had been painted over before I moved in. Immediately became a problem and did have a massive impact on my children\\'s health. I always had windows open, heating on. Didn\\'t dry clothes on radiators etc yet black mould spread everywhere no Matter how much I cleaned it. Landlord stuck a de humidifier in for a few days, it did nothing. He then blamed it on me having furniture that was by the walls. (Where else does it go?) my clothes were ruined as the In built wardrobe was the worst spot. There\\'s an ongoing issue with foxes in the garden that makes it difficult for the kids to play out safely. Ants infest the kitchen all summer long. Bathroom is downstairs and was falling apart although I think they may have upgraded it since it\\'s been empty.","895":null,"896":null,"897":"As much as I enjoyed my room, the whole experience with the letting agency (G&Q Residential) was terrible. Any concern was never properly dealt with, and at times, was laughed away. We wanted a lock fitted to the front door to enable us to get insurance, however, the agency laughed at us telling us a lock is not needed in London!!! Needless to say the lock was never installed and we were constantly told \\\"we will ask the landlord\\\".\n\r\nI was never inducted into the property and things were not explained properly. I was only told by my housemate that we couldn\\'t use the dishwasher (as I was never told) and then I was only told about hidden storage options 3 weeks before moving out (after 8\/9 months in the property). This came after numerous disputes regarding storage. \n\r\nIt took 6\/7 months to finally get a key for the front door. For those months we had to go in through the back door by the communal bins.\n\r\nEven though a weekly cleaner was included in the rental cost, we saw no evidence of a cleaner doing any sort of cleaning job. When we mentioned this to them, they would always say \\\"its a courtesy\\\". Therefore, the communal areas would get dirtier and then we would be told to keep the place clean\n\r\nFinally, on many, many occasions, we would return home from work and find that the agency had been in the flat and moved everything round in the kitchen. When we asked why, they would only say \\\"its a communal area, you sign for the room\\\". However, as it is communal, we had all been okay with how the kitchen had looked.\n\r\nI would severely recommend not signing with this agency. For the whole tenancy, we were lied to and had false promises made constantly.","898":"The property had a great view and you can see London Eye and Shard! But BE AWARE the property has condensation in its severest form, the built in wardrobe is along the external wall and in winter the water makes it way through, leaving all clothes wet. Thick black mould forms everywhere, particularly severe in small bedroom. When i was checking out i moved my daughters bed to realise that my daughter was sleeping in the company of thick black mould for months and we did not know as it was hidden by the bed. \n\r\nIn summer carpet moths will make an entry there were hundreds of them and in the night they fly - you find them even on your bed.\n\r\nLandlady does not want to spend any money. She only has a half handyman who tries to fix things temporarily. Kenwood guys proposed her a permanent solution for condensation but she did not want to spend the money - it costed about \u00a32k.\n\r\nSo if you can manage to live in a property with mould and moths - i.e. use bleach and clean mould every day, use dehumidifiers (2-3 of them, one provided by landlady), use moth sprays and moth remedies, go for this flat.\n\r\nMy Recommendation AVOID!","899":"Rooms in front of railways, impossible to sleep due to train noises passing 2meters away from the windows. The washing machine broke and wasn\u2019t fixed until 2 months later. \r\nRooms are comfortable and furniture is new, flatmates are professionals in their 20-30s, very respectable.","900":"I loved living in this flat. The property is owned by a large property company that actively manage their portfolio and the service was great. They were very responsive and helpful. The building was also kept clean, and it was a gated building that was very secure.  The neighbours were mostly nice, some were very private and never said hello even in the lift, but others were lovely and I made one or two friends. I only moved out as I moved in with my partner. Highly recommended.","901":null,"902":null,"903":null,"904":null,"905":null,"906":null,"907":"Just a warning: Be careful with this landlady.

The landlady argued with us regarding all furniture and wanted to keep a big part of our deposit to fix things that were brocken before we even moved in.","908":null,"909":"The house is really cold, I had to have the heating on even on July (with 25 degrees outside) and sleep with two duvets. The kitchen is small but enough for one person. It doesn\\'t have a proper bedroom, the bed is in a platform above the dinner table (which was provided by the landlord already broken). The TV provided by the landlord was broken as well, and even if he makes you pay as \\'full-furnished\\' it is not, and I had to buy many things for the kitchen and the house. I had a problem with the boiler and I was without the possibility to take a shower for 2 weeks, and the landlord didn\\'t do anything to try to solve the problem before. I had three times the black waters in front of my house. I do not recommend this house a lot, it would be better to destroy it and rebuild it again.","910":"The Landlords of this property have a history of trying to sell property in between long term contract and failed to sell for several years. They end contract before official end date to get new tenants at higher price every year so its not a stable home environment for any family wanting to rent this property as the long term contract is never fulfilled however I was there for over a year but given section 21 and told it was sold but now seen it\u2019s on rent again after moving out for more than double the rent I paid. Most importantly the property was left in better condition than when moving in and maintained well and the checking out reports from estate agents provided this information but the landlords delay and demand damages even when advised not to by the agents making a fuss for things the agent says is unreasonable so I have to claim from TDS . Landlord thinks they can make extra money from tenants deposits and increase rent exceptionally high by moving tenants every year when there was a 3 year contract.  I am not the first to experience this when I did my research on this property. If you are a family wanting security then there is a game played by landlords not considering the tenants at all especially wanting deposit monies when deemed unreasonable even by Chancellors the estate agents who try to sell or rent consistently for years now.  Just be aware if you want honesty and landlords with integrity then you will not find that with this property and I don\u2019t want another family to go through what I did.  The neighbours either side of the house are nice but the street has a few incidents of antisocial behaviour to the point that police have turned up opposite the house on many occasions.","911":null,"912":"The house on a whole is a nice property, the neighbours are fantastic, location great within walking distance to local amenities and a great high school nearby, \r\nIf you\u2019re considering this property be aware that the landlady will fluctuate rental to cover any major repairs.

What House doesn\u2019t need decorating when living there nearly 10 years. \r\nShe claimed she never gave permission for us to decorate. the deposit scheme is only to protect the landlord, We lost our deposit for property she also claimed that the garage door needed replacing which me managed to prove otherwise after the property was relisted with the same garage door.\r\nIt\u2019s sad when good tenants get treated poorly by money grabbing rich landlords.","913":null,"914":"Dr Gupta is an excellent landlord.

And I\\'m sure he will come up with more reasons to eventually get every single penny of the deposit. The house itself is of cheap material. The dishwasher and fridge were filthy.

The same goes with the cistern in the bathroom. It came away from the wall within a week of being in the property.

They did not fix issues, refused to pay when we had problems and had to arrange our own external repairs.","977":"Beware - there are serious problems with boilers in Arthur Court. At the time I moved out it didn\\'t look like it was going to be fixed and it had been the case for more than 5 years. There are several boilers in the common areas of the building that are supposed to supply all the flats with heating and hot water, and all of the boilers are past serviceable life. \r\nI lived in the flat from September 2017 till April 2018. In the first four months (September-December 2017) I didn\\'t have hot water for approximately one week out of every month, and no heating at all for most of that period because of the problems with boilers. This included the Christmas holiday. On 13 January heating was completely switched off in all the flats to prioritise hot water, and had not been restored by the time I moved out in April. Windows in the building are single-glazed, so it was freezing cold. Problems with hot water persisted. The building management sent a letter saying they would present a plan on how to raise funds to fix the boilers by the end of Q1 2018 which wasn\\'t done at the time I moved out (end of April 2018).\r\nOn top of constant boiler issues my flat was also broken into despite this being a portered block with CCTV. A known criminal (based on CCTV footage) broke the entire lock mechanism off of the door while I was at work (see photos below). \r\nI contacted my landlord and Westminster Council regarding the boiler issues, but I was told nothing could be done to fix this situation as Arthur Court is a freehold agreement, and some of the owners didn\\'t want to pay for boiler replacement.\r\nI strongly discourage you from moving into Arthur court as the quality of housing is incredibly low.","978":"The landlords (a couple) seems very sympathetic except, they have failed to make clear they are using the garage just below the living space of the tenant. The building is made of wood and the noise of the car they constantly put in, take out to clean is excruciating. The garage is constantly being opened. The noise of the garage door seems like a chain from the Tower of London. Listen to that several times in the day, specially now, working from home, and you will soon become insane. \n\r\nAnother thing they failed to mention was that the landlord would be working full-time under the place where you live. He does a lot of wood work and fixing so you can hear wood being cut very, very loudly. He will deny it despite, you have seen him by going outside.\n\r\nSince he can be under your floor from 7:30 to 22:30 to 23:00 in the night, including weekends, forget about privacy and quiet enjoyment of your home. \n\r\nYou also don\u2019t have any recycling bins. You are supposed to use their recycling bins which... are always full. One day after I approached the landlord to get a place to put my kitchen waste he got me a composter. That was really nice but when I returned from a day out he took the composter out without consulting me and, then in a very casual way, told me to clean the massive pile of rotten food that was inside the compost bin. I had to ask for a shovel so I didn\\'t have to buy one. The reason? He said he had an infection of rats which is fair enough but, he was the one who put the bin next to my house when, he has a massive land in the back where the bin could have been allocated. And I had to clean that too.\n\r\nThe landlord manages your Mail. So expect your letters to be opened once and awhile, by mistake or not, I am not sure. \n\r\nWhen I approached the landlord he doesn\u2019t acknowledge anything and escalates things. Walk away. It\u2019s a bit intimidating.","979":null,"980":"Since I received the keys to the house, I have had nothing but problems.

My wife and I have just bought our first new build property, but we had a very good time living in Flat 6. Reasons it is so good include:\n\r\n1. Location is absolutely amazing, close to the Chelsea Road shops, on the main route for the X39, A4 bus, close to Bristol-Bath bike path and Two Tunnels route; Lidl, M&S, Argos, etc; 20 minute walk to the city centre of Bath. Newbridge area is lovely; I already miss it.\n\r\n2. Really nicely done out flat; the kitchen is incredible; bathrooms are really well fitted too, modern and in excellent condition.\n\r\n3. Long nature of the Flat, mostly South facing, means you get the sun shining in through various windows and the flat stays warm and has just a really nice positive feeling to it. We hardly paid anything for bills (about \u00a3300 refund from Octopus energy) - you don\\'t even need to turn the heating on in winter if the sun is shining. Really well insulated.\n\r\n4. Two decent sized bedrooms and two bathrooms, including one with a bath which is just amazing. Ashley did a really good job of fitting these.\n\r\n5. Nice entry way and nicely done out garden space and shedding at the back (bike store).\n\r\n6. Your own parking space included, right outside the house, without any stressful parallel parks, just no price to put on that.\n\r\n7. Ashley is an exceptional landlord, a very nice person and always there to answer questions and sort out snags (although honestly there weren\\'t very many snags).\n\r\nSome relatively minor drawbacks:\n\r\n1. The flat is so well insulated that it does not cool down very much in summer. You will need to invest in a water cooler\/ portable air conditioning to be able to sleep.\n\r\n2. The main road is very noisy if you open the windows (which had to happen in summer months). With the windows closed you can still hear the road, but you get used to it very quickly (and some people like the \\\"buzz\\\" \/ energy of that). When I was working at home in summer I had to close the windows to hear my videocalls, which made it very hot.\n\r\n3. Fridge and freezer are relatively small for a 2 bed flat; it\\'s the only thing that\\'s missing in the kitchen. All the other storage spaces are more than enough; arguably better than our new build kitchen.\n\r\nDespite the last three minor issues I would give this a 10\/10 and would definitely like to still live in the flat if we weren\\'t trying to get on the property ladder. You won\\'t find a better place like this in Bath in my opinion (and I\\'ve looked to comparable places\/prices - they are a joke). You won\\'t regret choosing here, and personally, I\\'d much prefer to pay a private landlord than line the pockets of the letting agents.","985":"The flat was infested with moth, didn\\'t have a gas safety certificate in place, didn\\'t have working heating in the largest area of the property for seven months, had bad damp and condensation problems, and the alarm was faulty (it would go off at random times, waking us up and bothering the neighbours). There was a range of other slightly less serious issues. \n\r\nAfter constant pressure from me to sort out the most serious issue (gas safety), they sent two different gas engineers. Both concluded that various gas appliances were unsafe. As this and other issues were not resolved promptly, I had to involve the Council. As soon as the landlord knew about the Council\\'s involvement, he served a Section 21 notice, making use of the 6-month break clause. I asked for a couple of months so my daughter could finish her school year but the landlord was adamant and even took me to court as retaliation. He intended to keep a substantial percentage of my deposit - we even had to go to arbitration. I finally got my full deposit back but the process was draining and time-consuming. \n\r\nI would not recommend this landlord or agency to anyone.","986":null,"987":null,"988":null,"989":"The landlord (Ross Everitt) was exceptionally rude, dismissive & inattentive to any needs on our behalf being myself, my fiancee & 5 children.

He seemed to be under the impression that i would be foolish enough to carry out his instructions if he tried to bully me enough. I could add numerous email correspondence to this review that would leave you gobsmacked at the pure cheek of the guy. In the end, i had to threaten legal action to get him to leave us alone after we vacated the property, as he had left himself open to legal action due to not placing all of the \u00a33000 security deposit i had paid to him into the TDS protection scheme. He finally stopped contacting me after legal proceeding were mentioned to him along with the name & address of the solicitors who were going to be taking the case up for me.","990":null,"991":"Landlord refused to accept there was a problem. He is very dictatorial and controlling and we had to get environmental health involved","992":"The only benefit of this property is the location, being situated very close to various universities and amenities, and the security guard was extremely friendly and helpful - however, this is where the pros end. The walls are so thin that it is possible to hear conversations in a room three doors down the hallway in one flat. The communal kitchen is disgusting, with only the bare essentials. If the lights and the hob are switched on at the same time in the kitchen, the whole flat will fuse, and it is extremely difficult to get the power back on, especially since X1 do not seem to care or want to help their tenants at all. The plug in the kitchen sink was blocked and smelled disgusting, and the washing machine left clothes steaming for hours afterwards and so hot to the touch that it was worrying. Flooring inside my room was breaking and curving upwards at the edges, and the bathroom looked closer to a prison than a flat which has the rent stability of a yoyo. Reported several issues to maintenance, who did nothing to fix anything - as a result, I am now at risk of losing my deposit because maintenance did not fix anything which was reported whilst I was a tenant. Slats holding the bed up snapped as soon as I sat on the mattress, and I was threatened several times by another tenant, to the point that I felt unsafe in my own flat.","993":"This is a review for one of the studios in this property. It is call Flat 2. The main issue is that it is 15 sq. m. including the shower room. (Approximately 150 sq. f.) So it is quite expensive if you look at the price for the area you get. Now I\\'ll try to describe it by zones in different paragraphs after talking about admin matters.\n\r\nYou will probably have to rent it paying an state agent but later it is the Landlord who deal with the fixing. At least it was like this when we where there. He didn\\'t turn up to sign the contract and a lady from the state agent did it. Later we could find our that the contract wasn\\'t that relevant apparently. The deposit was property protected and it took us around 3 weeks to get it after chasing the landlord. Electricity and waters bills are included in the rent. You will have to pay the council tax that it was nearly \u00a31,000 a year.\n\r\nOut site the building looks and was just a house. Each room has been transformed into an studio so at some point, including the people renting the garden flat, there where around 15 souls living in this place. Whole families are living in these very small studios. Nearly no one recycle property so bins are usually a mess at the front of the house. There is no proper box mail for each flat so letters just arrive for all tenants mixed through the door. There is no proper ring-bells for each flat either. In the entrance you can find an unventilated hall where the boiler tint the walls in black dust. The shared washing machine is also there and it can take up 3 weeks to get fixed (the new one was performing some better though) Generally speaking the shared areas are in bad conditions and this was aggravated by a 2 calendar year construction site next door that was still going on the day we left. Builders were allow to use our shared outside area. This made things really unpleasant. \n\r\nInside, the studio is small. It is basic and quite functional too. The sink does a lot of noise every time the persons upstairs open their tap. And eventually also get blocked and then the landlord send somebody to unblock it. The noise problems don\\'t go. We manage to make it OK by using the plug and putting a weight on it. Heating performs nicely. The shower tray is 70 by 70 cm. \n\r\nWe quite enjoyed the garden by having a shed, having our bikes there and planting strawberries and chives.","994":"The landlord does not care about the living standards of the tenant at this property. Single glazed throughout, with no central heating just electric conduction heaters, we only heated the living room in the winter, and that cost us \u00a330+ a week alone. The high street serves over 10 major bus routes and at least 2 that run 24 hours a day, sleep is at a premium if you live here. The adjoining property is also owned by the same landlord and consists of the same poor standards, in this instance the landlord is taking advantage of the tenants also, knowing that they have nowhere else to go. We made is as best a family home as we could for the 3 years but as soon as we could, we moved. On one occasion I answered the door at 10pm to a man standing with a knife in my face, it was one of the men living in the house next door. Another incident was when the shop below decided to turn the water supply off overnight. When I confronted him, he denied all knowledge, as I went back up to the property, as if magic, the supply was on again! The landlord was called over this, and visited straight away but could not see a problem. Thames Water were also useless as the supply comes through the shop. To summarise, I would avoid this property and landlord like the plague. Whilst the landlord is friendly to speak to, his interest is to trap a tenant in the property, knowing full well that they cannot afford to leave, and not spend a penny of investment or maintenance on the property. You would be better off sleeping in the car park across the road, which by the way, is the only parking space for miles, at \u00a31,200 per year for a parking space. AVOID.","995":"We wanted to be able to call this our home for the long term - we\u2019ve painted the whole place to remove the staining from when we came in and brought in several new bits of furniture to the \u2018furnished\u2019 property. The poor communication and unwillingness to fix issues of the landlord though makes it impossible. \r\nPaulette Lemonius likes to ignore problems, palms off fixing requests and when eventually gets someone in to do work they are handy men without the ability to get the job done well or quickly. Examples: The top apartment\u2019s toilet leaked over our bathroom causing the roof to eventually rot away and fall on our heads while showering. It was over 6 months before anything was done when this issue was first raised and even then it took a number of very long appointments and three different handymen to sort it out. Dry rot has existed in our lounge room for over one year and despite frequent requests it was only dealt with three months ago and has since come back causing paint to bubble and discolor again. No handy man is yet to assist despite many requests with sorting it once and for all. Our most recent saga is that our front door lock has broken and while anyone else would get in a locksmith to sort it quickly her partner tried for 8 hours to sort it and left without the security lock functioning - it doesn\u2019t snob security into the wall. \r\nA report was provided to the landlord over a year ago recommending the boiler be replaced which hasn\u2019t happened, and the down lights which were fitted years ago by an unqualified electrician not to code and have caused charring on structural beams. Ms Lemonius was issued a notice requiring them to be changed and only 6 of the 24, or 2 rooms, are yet to be done so we\u2019re potentially living in a fire hazard. Our bin is also broken with a missing lid but she won\u2019t pay the \u00a350 to replace it so foxes frequent our patio and make a mess. \r\nOur neighbours had some similar issues with the responsiveness of the landlord and quality of the flat and left not long ago. \r\nStreet parking is relatively easy and aside from Saturday nights the area is relatively quiet - unless you\u2019re a light sleeper. The planes going overhead at all hours can be a little much. \r\nPeople don\u2019t respect traffic signs and speed up and down the street...that coupled with the group of 20 young men who regularly hang at the top of the street smoking weed and doing drug deals, this probably isn\u2019t the place for children. \r\nTraffic is always congested at Brixton and Clapham North junctions but the flat is close to both the Northern and Victoria tube lines as well as Clapham High St overground. \r\nPolice have notified us of breakins in the street twice in the last year but we\u2019ve never felt unsafe walking around outside.","996":"We had to get this house because this was the closest to my school. Not because we wanted to. The rent is really high considering the other houses around it. \n\r\nAnd I am only rating because the landlord is horrible. The landlord made the estate agent call her and show her everything while in FaceTime. She invaded our privacy we never felt like this was our house. Before we moved in the house there was problems with old dirty curtains, the old couches witch had cockroach infestation, and the old boiler that never worked properly. The curtains were damaged and was fixed six months after we settled in, the couches were removed after 8 months of persuading the landlord to get rid of the nastiness, and the boiler was replaced a year later of reporting it to them. \n\r\nThe neighborhood is quite, except the planes at night which do make a scene. All I can say is that the landlord will not respect your privacy, and the estate agent will help her invade your privacy.","997":null,"998":"The property is in a council house estate so it is what it is.\r\nthe main problem you will face if you rent this property will be the landlord.\r\nI have been living and sleeping in a flat full of black mould for 1 year. the funny side is the at the end of tenancy the landlord had the balls to keep all the money because i did not clean the property professionally ( i have pictures that confirm the absolute opposite ) and because i didn\\'t paint over the mould which should be solved by the landlord himself and not just painted over.\n\r\ndo not rent this property or you will regret it!","999":"House was \\'ok\\' for the price (at \u00a31480pm) London expensive and low quality standards, furniture included with the house was of the cheapest IKEA quality as is the will of adding or changing things. Any time something broke, the Landlord was always understanding and he tried to fix everything manually himself and i consider him one of the great landlords i have come to know, BUT the agency drives him and the price house as much as possible, asking (sneakily) for rent increases at every possible occasion.\n\r\nWe moved out mainly because they tried to raise the rent by \u00a3170 per month (from \u00a31480 to \u00a31650) in a time (last year) when the market was a buyer\\'s market. When people from Europe is running back to their countries, leaving many flats empty and prices dropping.\n\r\nObviously, they could not manage to get their asking price, so it was rented at \u00a31600 instead and the only way they managed that is by squeezing a 3rd person (in a 2 bedroom house..., probably living in the living room) in, so it looks like a good deal...\n\r\nIn short, old and bad quality furniture, some carpeting was torn and never fixed, we had bed bugs every now and then that we did not introduce (Was there from the beginning) and the lack of trust towards the future on pricing, as well as the attitude towards getting more money out of it from the agents who have never visited the flat (how ironic - pricing something without looking at it) would make me say AVOID.\n\r\nThe entrance is through the back, as the house is on the high street, meaning there is a security door and a loooong corridor before you reach the entrance, meaning that when you are moving in or out or coming in or out from shopping you have a lot of walk and stairs before you are in. Even worse, the corridor to the entrance is always full of long left rotting garbage, flies, fast food left overs, beer bottles and cans and all that because the shops in the front of the house have the code, which they then distribute to their staff to lock their bikes etc.\n\r\nThe security door in question was broken and the landlord did not care to fix it or talk to the other people sharing it to fix it, it was only down to the kindness of one of the businesses to fix it.","1000":null,"1001":"Spacious house but single glazing made it very cold in winter. Problems with mice and slugs which landlord ignored and told us it was our problem as we left food out (we were really careful never to do this).\n\r\nLandlord would often expect immediate access to property whether it was convenient to us or not. Landlord was often deliberately vague in text and email communication. If something needed fixing we would have to sort out payment and\/or delivery ourselves and the landlord would reimburse us which wasn\\'t always convenient.\n\r\nWe were promised that some problems would be fixed on signing the new lease on the property but these were ignored once our tenancy started. Also, when my bed broke I had to sleep on the floor for a week as the landlord ignored my calls, texts and emails.","1002":"During my time in this property, I would say I have never had to contact my landlord with as many issues as I had during this tenancy.  When we moved in, the drainage in the kitchen was unacceptable - water from the washing machine would back up into the kitchen sink, and any water in the kitchen sink could take over half an hour to drain, and this problem took over 4 weeks to repair.  The hob only had two of four rings working and the ignition switch was broken, contravening gas safety standards.  It took several weeks for the landlord to measure for a replacement, and then several more weeks passed before the hob was delivered, and then several more before the repair occurred. The gas safety certificate later expired and we had to prompt the landlord to renew.  We had to have pest control investigations for mice infestation in our property and the downstairs flat, on two separate occasions.\n\r\nFinally, at the end of the tenancy, we were threatened with a deduction from our rent because the landlord claimed that the property was \\\"too untidy\\\" during viewings for prospective new tenants and that we had been warned about this, when no such warning was issued.  This was never acted upon and the deposit was returned in full, but we later discovered that the deposit had never been protected by the landlord as required by law.","1003":"Absolutely dreadful. Avoid at all costs. Landlord makes money by bringing in people who hate the place, quickly leave and lose their deposit because living in the property is so unpleasant.

The building is not adequately secure, so in addition to homeless people, youths enter the flat and damage the stairwells with cigarettes, drugs and litter.

We weren\\'t informed they were a pest problem when we moved in but they were. They lived on the balcony and made an extraordinary amount of mess, noise and damage.

Some areas of the building still do not have pigeon netting however, so excrement has piled up outside the front and in the car park.\n\r\n6) There is a problem at the flats with rubbish dumping and fly tipping. Other residents do not put their litter in the bins provided and throw it over the car park floor. Other residents\/landlords also fly tip old furniture (including beds, sofas and bath tubs) in the car park. This has caused a vermin problem (pigeons, mice, rats and flies).

After much complaining, landlord suggested I move out instead and a 6 month contract was agreed as a compromise instead of 1 year. \n\r\nNo lock on Room 1 door - landlord said he would replace all doors but this was never fixed.

The landlady is very relaxed about everything (except your rent) or at least it seemed to be in the beginning. Later I realized she\\'s way too relaxed, it\\'s rather negligence. Negligence all the way and if you have a complaint you get a bad response. I\\'d use another words, but not allowed here so by \\\"bad response\\\" you can imagine an angry women if you try to encourage her for getting stuff done. She doesn\\'t care for your well-being, she doesn\\'t really show up very often (which is good in a way, but ultimately shows she doesn\\'t care at all), and just for short periods of time to collect rent.\r\nI\\'d say she\\'s easygoing as long as you don\\'t complain about anything at all and you accept her way. Otherwise you will face a \\\"if you don\\'t like it you can leave\\\" attitude. Even with easygoing long term tenants like myself: did only request the bare minimum maintenance over the years, like for a broken washing machine we had to beg for weeks, or I hear from previous tenant (who still lives here) that before I moved in the house didn\\'t have a working gas heater for almost two winters. Now our new pain in our life is the poor internet. She changed the TalkTalk we had (which wasn\\'t the greatest the begin with) to a 4 Mbit iTalk contract (which may be upgraded to 30 Mbit at the most, may not, still debating on this), and there\\'re 5 people sharing this with numerous devices (yeah, good luck streaming anything at all, my messages won\\'t even load in busy hours). All this to save her like 15-20 quid a month... And the 5 of us generates her around 2 grands pcm. So long story short we agreed to pay 5 quid each on top of our rent (should be all inclusive) for a usable internet connection. Yeah, so you can guess her response for questioning: take it or leave it.\r\nBut the leaking basin tap wasn\\'t a problem for months. I bet we lost tons of water on than alone. But hey, who am I to judge? I leave it to the reader.\n\r\nSide note: in this global pandemic when all of the UK went on mortgage holidays and pretty much all my friends had their rents significantly reduced, guess what? Here we payed full rent all along. Response was a straight no. No place for debate. Take it or leave it...\r\nAnd now we\\'re facing an increase straight after this period.\n\r\nThe house itself is poorly maintained, it could really use a full overhauling, but that\\'s not gonna happen until it poses a safety hazard. Which of we already have some, like hanging electrical wires here and there, water leaks, etc. Other than that the property is full of the landlady\\'s belongings, I\\'d say it was properly cluttered almost like a hoarder\\'s house. Since then we tidied the place up a bit (shoved everything in corners of the property we don\\'t normally use, and got rid of some broken stuff we\\'re sure it would never be used again).\r\nAnyway I post a few pics for evidence, but in my honest opinion only those move in here in their right mind who are desperate. You can only find better places than this. It is good to have a roof above you, but you don\\'t really get any more than that, let alone to call it \\\"home\\\".\r\nIf you read this dear landlady, I hope you will be a better person in the future.","1101":"The flat is in bad conditions, no double glazing, which means it\\'s incredibly cold and humid in the winter even with the heating on.

Our Landlord Priya Littler would like us to pay \u00a3380 for a deep clean of the house so that her next tenants can move in.

Firstly it\\'s a great location being just opposite a UFO landing pad (research Hulme Park) and reasonably comfortable. However, there are 8 air con units outside the main bedroom.

The front room also gets a lot of noise intrusion from the beeping crossing directly out front, the traffic, and crowds hanging out outside the shop downstairs. Heating is poor quality but works, however it will not hold heat as in winter the icy wind gets funnelled under the door front making the storage heater in the hallway useless. If anything goes wrong be prepared for a war of attrition. I had to fight for three years to get some fire hazard repairs done!

Although the cleaner was nice, understanbly they were not in a position to answer any questions. Anyway, I decided to go with the property. 2. Signing up was alright, although there was extra paperwork involved since they required a guarantor despite me being in full-time employment. Also beware, our contract had a requirement for a 2-months notice 3. Also, I did not get a move-in date until the last minute and they didn\\'t seem to care much about it. 4. The biggest issue arose when our property had to be completely rewired. Communication was awful from their side with their description of what had to be done changing almost daily. After long negotiations, the works went ahead and lasted for more than a week interrupting our working lives during COVID and leaving our place in a complete mess (see photos). We were also left with no carpets\/laminate in one of the rooms and the landing for two-three months following the completion of the rewiring. On top of that, we received at least 4-5 emails\/calls, and 3 visits by different workmen before the floor was finally reinstalled with carpet although the rest of the property had laminate. Similar issues with rewiring were faced by all of our neighbours (some elderly) at Pelham Place. 5. They requested a monthly increase of \u00a355 after a year, at which point we (and some of our neighbours) decided to vacate 6. It took them more than a month to return our deposit. The landlord tried to claim \u00a3130 but their claims were so ridiculous that they had to drop them all after one rebuttal email. It is clear that the agency supports an opportunistic approach when it comes to deposits. Also, beware, their inventories are so very basic that they might leave you exposed at the end when they try and make claims. 6. Also, another word of caution, the agency will often claim that actions are ultimately up to the landlords, but in our case, at Pelham Place, the properties are actually owned by the immediate family 7. Staff turnover is bad and this only makes communication worse. Looking at Glassdoor comments you don\\'t get the impression that staff are treated well. 8. If anything goes wrong, their reflexes are to blame the tenants. E.g. there was a leak at the shop below and we got a patronising call informing us that we should be more careful cleaning the balcony drains. It then turned out that the leak had nothing to do with us. 9. After we decided to vacate, they sent an email sort of asking how we wanted to go about with viewings but in a matter of a few hours, we had received notices of scheduled viewings showing how much they valued our opinion. In one case, we were also not given the legal 24-hour notice. Pros: 1. You do get some contacts for emergency repairs. Their contractors are very friendly but not always the most professional. 2. Their properties tend to be on the cheaper end, but once you deal with them, you understand why. \n\r\nThe property itself is very sunny and warm and Chapel Allerton is very nice neighbourhood. Can get very noise on a Friday and Saturday night. Overall, we would not recommend the property because of the people that manage it. They are very profit orientated and don\\'t respect their tenants.","1173":"We had more than two years at this property and enjoyed a good relationship with the Landlady (based in Dubai) throughout.  There was no managing agent, so we were dealing with her direct all the time, which was slightly inconvenient considering her location, but she remained cooperative. The problems started when we moved out.  We notified the landlady that there was a small amount of damage to the paint on one of the walls of the nursery. She acknowledged this, and then suggested that \\'her\\' builder would charge \u00a3300 to repaint.  We felt this was too high, and offered to compromise at \u00a3150.  She rejected this and after the end of tenancycheckout etc stated that if we didn\\'t accept the \u00a3300 she would bill us for a new washing machine.  When we objected to this approach, she did in fact make good on her threat and deducted a further \u00a3428 from our deposit.  The case was sent for review within the deposit protection scheme, which ruled in our favor.  In the end just \u00a3100 was debited from our deposit, which we think was fair.  The whole process took more than 4 months to get the money back though.","1174":null,"1175":null,"1176":"A nice large flat in a great location - however take care in your dealings with the landlord!\r\nThe flat has a few issues - very noisy main road is an obvious one.

In three and half years our landlord never inspected the house to see if any upkeep was required in the property and has flagged a multitude of these issues as reasons to not release out deposit.

Also, he claimed I did not pay the rent before the agreed payment date (28th of each month), which is also untrue as I have made all the rent payments by internet banking in his account at least one day in advance.

It is definitely not worth the rent of \u00a3400 per month.","1241":"First of all the landlord didn\\'t have the decency to speak to us face to face when claiming they wanted to sell the property. We didn\\'t believe them & knew they wanted us to leave due to all the issues we\\'d reported & they hadn\\'t fixed. Unsurprisingly within a couple of days of us moving out the property was back up for rent at an increase of 25%. We were paying \u00a3875 a month & they now want \u00a31150. Utterly disgusting. Property is full of mould & damp on virtually every outside wall. Boiler losses pressure so often that you have to repressurise it monthly. Before we moved in they\\'d allowed a dog to wee all over the carpets & it stunk. Took them nearly 2 months to replace the carpets which when taken up made the fitter gip due to the smell. Landlord tries to fix things himself & he\\'s not very bright. Lovely area but definitely wouldn\\'t pay over \u00a3850 unless problems were sorted. Bathroom only has a small window & virtually impossible to get it free from mould. Double glazing in living room has failed as condensation permanently present. Requires replacing all the seals. Roof leaks when it rains & drips onto an electric fire!! Obviously we never used it. Another leak into kitchen extension which hasn\\'t been rectified correctly. Musty smell all the time & glad we got out in the end.","1242":"The landlord was unprofessional. Did not professionally clean the house when we moved it. Charged for professional cleaning. Started getting aggressive, threatening after end of tenancy when he had to return the deposit. Charged 502\u00a3 for cleaning of 2b2b and additional 400 for fixing small wear and tear of furniture.","1243":"I was lucky enough to have a very good estate agency. I appreciated their panctuality and care from day one, since they called me the first time around when my appointment was cancelled because someone else was interested, but they then call me back to rearrange as soon as the other person deop out. Their attitude is quite rare- they never charged me on the renewal of the contract, and they always responded very quickly to whatever i was asking. The landlord is also super- even though i didn\u2019t meet him in those years, he never raised the rent, and responded very quickly and positive with my requests (i.e. i asked for a replacement of the mattress which he did straight away). The house itself is very warm and quiet and i actually took it in the first place because it was bright on a cloudy day- and never dissappointed! The only marginally negative thing i have to say, is that the building itself has deteriorated a bit since i came- a few more students in the building means that it gets dirty in the lifts and communal places over the weekend. But as my first rental in Liverpool, i have to say it is a great property to live in and in a very convenient location!","1244":null,"1245":"Landlord lives in Australia so no issues were resolved in what we would describe as good time. Had 2 occasions where we were without heating or hot water. The 2nd occasion was just as the cold weather hit in Dec 2015, just before Christmas for nearly a month with a 1 year old in the house and no warm pack provided by the lettings agent - we had to approach a local charity for 2 oil filled radiators. Eventually replaced the boiler.\r\nHad issues with rats in the cavity walls, the loft and under the bath. Council was called, and paid for by us, to evaluate the property and put poison down. Lettings agent\/landlord were given works orders to secure the property to stop rats from gaining access to the property. Work was only completed after we contacted the council to inform them it hadn\\'t been done, 2 weeks after the set deadline.\r\nHad an issue with the only drain for the house. Water backed up and overflowed on to the pathway. Lettings agent refused to look in to it at first assuming it would be our responsibility and that we must have put something down the drains to cause the problem. Turned out the \\\"drain\\\" was actually just a massive hole in the floor under the decking, surrounded by top soil with a fridge shelf cemented into it. Only got sorted after 3 weeks of having to scoop the water out of the drain by hand after every use of the washing machine\/shower\/washing up and the next door neighbours writing a letter of complaint to both the lettings agent and the council. Kelrick lettings in Ashton-In-Makerfield are a waste of time. All these issues caused us to move from the property as we could no longer deal with the incompetence of the lettings agent and the landlord.","1246":"Sign up process is good, with landlord encouraging you to rate them there and then.  After that it goes down hill.  Any maintenance issues were either ignored even after significant  chasing.  Some repairs made such as broken shower but main issues such as broken fridge which is Icing up and pool of water in it remained ignored even at tenancy end.  Curtains in living room filthy and break easily landlord refused to replace as maintenance agency kept saying they just needed repaired (after about 6 callouts I gave up it was clearly a scam to get mote money out the landlord).  Property has approx 65 light bulbs most of which are over 3 meters high.  No ladders provided in property so landlord  charged me \u00a350 for replacement bulbs at end of tenancy despite me paying for professional clean.  Keys were never given for some of the doors required to access the property from the stairway and car park which was an on going complaint they never ended up resolving.  Landlord took nearly a month to refund deposit claiming it took a month to source costs for replacement light bulbs which somehow came in at a round \u00a350 figure. Kitchen and bathrooms majorly worn out and rusted fittings.  Doors hanging off and cistern flushing rusty water.","1247":null,"1248":"The landlord manages the property rather than the agents that showed me around, which would have been fine but the landlord lives in Dubai and was impossible to get hold of so in the end I was dealing with the landlords mother when ever there was a problem.  The landlords mother did respond to me when I contacted her usually after just a small wait and she did try and help but the problem was that she is neither the agent or the landlord so couldnt really help that well and wasnt particularly invested in doing the job as it wasnt her job to be fair but this made it difficult to fix any issues when they came up as I didnt really want to bother her given that it was not really her problem to solve.","1249":null,"1250":"This is a lodging property with a professional couple and their secondary school-aged daughter. I experienced the following issues from the outset:\n\r\nNo contract - I was given a single piece of paper covering payment, exit, and cleaning, with meagre details about house rules. I asked for a contract and was refused one.\n\r\nHouse rules were explained on a walkaround with the landlady, constituting a verbal agreement.  Later in the year the rules were changed arbitrarily and without my agreement, as is required under a verbal contract. For example, cooking after 9pm was initially allowed but a curfew was later imposed.\n\r\nI was subject to harassment and bullying by the landlady - for example, I often received angry texts about minor infractions blamed on myself. I was routinely told my room smelled, though it suffered from damp and had not been cleaned from the previous tenant. I was ordered to leave my window room open when I went out, constituting a fire\/burglary risk. The landlady routinely went into my room, meaning I had no privacy, and harassed me about tidiness and my personal possessions.\n\r\nThe room itself was well turned-out, with a double bed, wardrobe, desk and chair, lamp, and chest of drawers. However, the room had a squeaky laminate floor that caused echoes and loud sounds beyond my control; these also became a source of harassing comments. There was also no lock on the door.\n\r\nThis is not a good house for someone with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues: the landlady and landlord had no awareness about such conditions, which became a factor in the bullying and harassment. \n\r\nThe atmosphere in the house was often stressful. Incidents of the landlady harassing myself often took place in front of others, including her daughter. Unexpected guests were common; for three months a homeless man was given shelter until he stole money from one of the bedrooms. This contributed to a general unsafe atmosphere.\n\r\nOn leaving the house I was unfairly charged for replacement furniture. I contested this successfully but had to threaten legal action to do so, which likely would not have happened had a formal contract existed between myself and the landpersons.","1251":"The insulation is really bad, and that is why I cannot recommend this property. This apartment is built on top of the roof. There are gaps where the walls meet the floor so there is draft. There is no gas heating, so electricity bill is quite big.\r\nAdditionally, there are problems with the internet. The ADSL phone cable net was dropping connection so had to change to mobile net eventually. No fiber cable available.","1252":null,"1253":"The shower in bathroom is not working. It\\'s bath only.","1254":"Property is highly infested with mice, cockroaches and bedbug. House cleaning is very bad, boiler is not working since a year. Kitchen is too dirty and in total mess.","1255":null,"1256":"Rented a single room as a lodger (live in landlord). The landlord took a \u00a3450 deposit, which was not returned on leaving, he could not give a fair reason but as I didn\\'t have paperwork to prove it, I could not take the claim further. During my time living there the landlord was hostile; he didn\\'t allow his tenants free use of heating, cooking and washing facilities. He entered into my room without permission on multiple occasions. The bathroom was disgusting, blocked shower was never fixed.\r\nAll round worst landlord experience ever. DO NOT RENT HERE!","1257":"The agents are at different place from the property, so that actions are mostly delayed. this property is studio with communal garden so there will be always issues with rodents and insects (spiders). \n\r\nexcellent studio, but should have been maintained well.","1258":"I have a very reasonable and kind landlord","1259":"The Good:\r\n1. The apartment is well-ventilated and has enough natural light. In winter, the living room and small bedroom get direct sunlight for a couple of hours which is helpful. However, the master bedroom doesn\\'t get direct sunlight due to direction\/angle. \r\n2. It is close to the main road and the bus stop (1-minute walk to the bus stop) and the bus frequency to go to oxford centre is good on most days\/times. It is very quiet in spite of being close to the main road.\r\n3. The view from the windows is pleasant. \r\n4. Open layout of the kitchen\/dining area\/living room gives the house a very spacious feeling. \n\r\nThe Bad:\r\n1. The bathrooms\/toilets are carpeted. This makes cleaning toilets and bathrooms a very difficult process wasting 1 hour every weekend as you have to clean without letting the water fall out. If excess water falls, it leads to mould in the carpet which can be very very difficult to remove. Any toilet accidents (if you have small kids or guests with poor aim :p ) can again lead to major problems in maintenance. Our request to change the flooring inside the bathrooms was denied by the landlord. \n\r\n2. The landlord is quite unresponsive. We requested a change of dining chairs (they were in very poor condition since the start of our let, and by mid-tenure, had become unusable). The requests had to be routed through the lettings agent. After we raised the request, the agent got back to us after 1 month asking for more details. After we furnished the details, the agency never got back to us and never replaced the chairs. \n\r\n3. Its been 2 months+ since we left the apartment but we still have not received our deposit back. The landlord\/agent informed us about proposed discussions after 4 weeks after our vacating the place. When we countered the offer, the landlord\/lettings agent has again not responded to our counter for 4 weeks. This is in spite of our constant reminders to speed the process. \n\r\n4. The under-the-floor heating provided in this apartment is absolutely useless  (ineffective and costly). It takes 2-2.5 hours after we turn on the heating for the room to start getting to a comfortable temperature. This means we need to keep the heater on for longer period (leading to higher cost) and when we are feeling cold, there is no immediate relief that we can hope for from heaters. \n\r\n5. The building maintenance company is equally unresponsive. The garbage bins provided are not sufficient for the number of flats they cater to. This means the bins are often overflowing make the bin shed very dirty. Inspite of multiple complaints to building maintenance, they rarely take action to fix the problem. This lack of attention from them has been raised by other tenants in the building too.","1260":"The flat is a very good size. It take a while to heat up in winter months, the back room are always cold all year round. The noise from the pub is barnacle during the week but of a weekend it\\'s ridiculous. There is a takeaway directly under the property and we can hear every conversation. The space at the back is full of Rats caused by the rubbish that is dumped there. There is no parking so we have to park on the main road, this becomes very contested during rush hour and school drop off and pick up time as we are situated directly facing a school.","1261":null,"1262":"Landlady pretends to be a victim, but is a complete narcissist. Interferes in everything. Has dog that barks all night long. Mattresses have bed bugs and fleas. Only stayed so long because of lockdown. The house had five bathrooms, but 2 did not work, 1 she locked and a further one she kept for herself, and would scream at anybody trying to use it. Everything looks fine at a causal glance but nothing was maintained properly. For example within days of moving in the ceiling in my room had collapsed, covering everything in plaster. The estate agent advertises the property as an HMO, but does not tell you the landlady lives on site.","1263":null,"1264":null,"1265":"The house seemed nice and clean at first but after a couple of weeks we started noticing what was wrong; the ceiling in the bathroom was leaking every time it rained heavily, making it dangerous to go to the toilet at night or bare feet. The electricity is really really bad and the wooden ceiling in the kitchen is slowly burning all around the light bulb. We told the landlord multiple times about all these problems and he never did anything.","1266":"Flat had rising damp in the living room which was not fixed in the whole 2.5 years we lived there. Landlord\/agency eventually had a survey done but never followed up on it and so never fixed the issue whilst we were still living there. Due to the massive disruption it would have caused I did not willingly contact them about it so had to live with the issue.\r\nNeighbours in the other flats are rude (do not notify you of their flat works so scaffolding went up around the whole house without telling us of it and builders were there for nearly 2 weeks). Another neighbour is awake till 5am most evenings with her standing outside the front communal door smoking and coming and going disturbing my sleep as the bedroom wall is next to the communal corridor.","1267":"Good afternoon everybody,\n\r\nI rented this property one year ago, which is by one main train line and I will never do that again as the noise is constant and too loud (my bad), specially with cargo trains even through the night and early morning (e.g. 4:00am), being forced to sleep with earplugs the whole year. Also, the entire house vibrates when a train comes by, not dramatically, but you can feel it. Apart from that, the property is quite spacious and bright most of the time and it has a nice garden, but again I did not enjoy because of the noise. The neighborhood is completely safe though.\n\r\nSimilarly, when we moved in there were a few things broken or that needed to be replaced like light bulbs, exterior lights, hot water tap and the fire alarm did not have any battery fitted!! It looked that the landlord did not care too much about what was going on around the house. In addition, the double glazed window in the bedroom (Velux) was broken, which means that one of the glasses was not properly sealed and it did not sit properly on the frame, so I would have frozen in winter, but thanks to the adhesive sealing for windows that you can buy at any DIY shop I could keep it reasonably warm (high gas bill). By the way, all the windows are wooden ones and single glazed!!. Moreover, there was a bent pipe beneath the sink and we had to fight, even threat, the landlord to get it repaired after a few months, although he was trying to blame us for that. To summarize, the property needs a big refurbishment because I could go on all day talking about these things.\n\r\nFocusing on the landlord, he has not been very helpful and he has avoided his responsibilities till the last minute. Also, when he showed us the property he looked in a rush because he knows about the train and he also gave misleading information about the frequency of the them. In conclusion, I would not trust him.\n\r\nOverall, an overpriced property for its location and also the landlord has not done anything to decrease the nuisance of the train in years and based on my experience he will not do it, even if he tells you that he will. Another case of money grabbing around Oxfordshire, as it is being advertised for higher price after I moved out and no improvements has been undertaken at all, however there are good landlords too. Piece of advice, the further you live from Oxford the better quality of life you are going to have in every aspect (i.e. cheaper rent and newer houses)\n\r\nI hope it helps somebody.\n\r\nKind regards,\n\r\nRusso41","1268":null,"1269":null,"1270":null,"1271":null,"1272":"Mould in rooms\r\nRats\r\nFilthy\r\nWas rubbish dumped outside for months in garden and front.\r\nRadiators do not work so the building us freezing.\r\nCracked windows \r\nSometimes insufficient notice given for visits. \r\nBadly decorated. \r\nFailed to provide prompt maintenance works.

First of all, the property is very humid, there is a leak from upstairs and then a mould appeared on the wall. It is not bright at all, and there is always a smell in the house. In addition, the landlord\\&#39;s behavior and attitude to us as tenants has been awful. Several times he or his people from repairment office broke in to the house, without a notification. Once the alarm went off and the main box was broken, so we could not shut t down, and the landlord was not picking up. Moreover, in a few days he came and told us that he ws going to charge us for the alarm.. :( I found it awful, as it was not even our fault. The landlord behavior is something that might make your life in the flat horrible, as he does not have any subordination and likes to scream at people, and listens only to what he is saying.! I have never in my life had such a horrible experience in my life! ANd in the beginning the landlord will be very nice, before he starts thinking how to keep your deposit and make up things that were broken before you move in. Just, try not to rent a property with them because you will always get a problem.","1278":"at the time of leaving ,deposite settlement was not done properly.during stay ..heating was not proper.example like sink blokage,issues with hob,washing mashing not working.while leaving i neglected everyting .there was one iron mark from my side,and i was ready to pay half ,but landlord wanted for the full replacement.later they want me to pay 70% of carpet price.for normal wear and tear during stay..they want me to charge.","1279":null,"1280":"The landlord began the entire process by being rude and abrasive, accusing us of giving false details for our guarantors and wasting his time when we asked him questions about the tenancy. We were given no briefing about the tenancy document before being asked to sign and post it back. After the awful beginning, we were extremely reluctant to contact him about anything and when we did, had to wait a long time before getting a response. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic he has been less than considerate and very unhelpful, giving use deadlines for deciding to renew the tenancy and when our move out date is. We also had to hire cleaners after moving in due to left over food on the floors and grime in the kitchen. I would avoid purely because of the landlord\\'s behaviour towards tenants.","1281":null,"1282":"Ethical landlord","1283":null,"1284":null,"1285":"I do not recommend this property for anyone who would not be aware about the cleaning standards and definitions made by the landlord. We hired professionals to clean the areas mentioned by our landlord and still it wasn\u2019t appreciated. We also received a message where we were bulleyed  by them for a simple reason of not receiving their call when they tried ringing us on their first attempt auctioned between a span of 2-3 minutes and message following very next. We gave them a notice period of 3 months and they seemed to be very uncivilised in their behaviour - where if they raised their voice and cut us in between it was moral but if we did that in response(every actions has an equal reaction)  it was disrespect. The landlord has traditional temporary ways of fixing things and to end it on a good note I usually did give a good end to it in conversations we had but the furniture he provided from a perfect condition came down to a Useable condition ( again he decides what is perfect and useable) we even asked them to change the mattress and discard furniture  but they didn\u2019t change where we even mentioned we will Pay for the mattress and sofa ourselves. Absolutely ended not like we expected. Now they want money from our deposit to provide a new tenant with a brand new mattress and to clean the apartment fully again. Waste of our time but we will go the lengthy process of dps as our money is hard earned. Also very heavy mould and condensation issues in this flat. The flat is also very close to the pipe and because it is a corner flat the toilet cleaner told us clogging might only affect us mainly and we had a flood of toilet water and shit oozing out on the floor directed towards living room and bedroom as well.","1286":"The flat is 465B. There is always confusion finding the address at all websites especially during the application on any government website. The floor is caving in in the middle, so you can imagine trying to sit on a swivel chair with wheels. There is no reception on telephones except right at the front windows. Neither the landlord nor the agent checked the flat before letting and if they did, they hid the defects. Lights were not working properly, extractor fan full of water and caused a short circuit, washing machine last inspection date was 5 years ago. The flat is dim during the day and we were not allowed to touch anything, so we could not see a lot. The furniture belongs to the recycle center and the landlord refuses to move it. Toilet seats are loose and the landlord claim they are new. Not worth the money. We had to do a lot of cleaning and maintenance on our own.","1287":null,"1288":"We ( my husband and I) were defrauded of \u00a32500 by the landlord when moving out of the property. The landlord had asked us to vacate the property on the 1st of October 2019 as he wanted the property to be empty, to sell it faster. The house had been on the market since 10th of May 2019 and was being marketed by Purplebricks. However we were unable to vacate the property by the 1st of October as our next property wasn\u2019t going to be ready till the 25th of October 2019 and asked him to grant us an extension of the date to vacate the property. He said he was planning to move into the property himself and will only allow us to stay on in the property till the 25th of October if we paid him \u00a32500 plus the rent till the 1st of November 2019,in cash . My husband is a doctor in the NHS and \u00a32500 is quite a big amount of money for us, whereas the landlord is a rich businessman. Even then he took \u00a32500 from us saying he needed to pay his removal company All Moves \u00a32200, and \u00a3300 to his cleaners and that the amount was non-refundable and couldn\u2019t be cancelled. He couldn\u2019t postpone the removals and cleaners to a later date either, which we thought was highly irregular as we know from experience, having used a lot of these removal companies, that it is possible to postpone the removal dates. \n\r\n             We agreed to pay the money to him on the condition that he will forward the removal and cleaner receipts to us, which he promised to do. However in spite of asking him many times for the receipts since then, we haven\u2019t got them as yet. He hasn\\'t refunded the money back to us either in spite of my asking him innumerable times to refund the \u00a32500 back to us. I have complained to the estate agent, Purplebricks but they weren\\'t at all interested in acting on my complaint and stopped taking my calls regarding my complaint.\n\r\nWhat really shocks me is how easily the landlord defrauded us without any regard for tenancy laws, criminal or civil laws of England. He was very sure that he could get away with it. He has absolutely no conscience whatsoever and no regard for his tenants.

As a group they are poorly informed of proper contracting and tenants rights so please read your contract very thoroughly before signing here as it contains contradictions, ambiguous statements and contradictions of tenant rights. In addition they are very slow to make repairs and very quick to assign blame to the tenants for issues the tenants have not caused. When moving in, I paid the deposit as stipulated then the day before moving was texted to ask for the first months rent in cash the following morning. This should either have been requested at the time of contract signing, or, as stipulated by the unclear contract was not owed at all. The daughter refused to give me the keys until I had handed over the money (at this point I had no idea who she was and had not previously met her) and stated that as I was unable to withdraw this much cash in one go she \\\"did not trust\\\" me and \\\"felt like not giving me the keys at all\\\". She was over an hour late to bring the keys and by the time she agreed to hand the keys over (having had to transfer money to the landlord and wait for him to call her to confirm) I had less than an hour to move my things form the neighbouring town.\r\nSubsequently every dealing with the daughter she has been abrupt, not bothered to communicate with all tenants or simply come into the property without written notice.\r\nThe landlords stated that there were 3 parking spaces but only 2 tenants with cars. In fact they had let knowingly to 4 tenants with cars leaving one to purchase a permit elsewhere.\r\nI addition, all tenants are currently paying different rates for their room, not contingent on size or furnishing. One tenant was informed they have a private bathroom so had to pay more rent, which the other tenants were told is communal. The individual in the smallest and noisiest room is paying the highest rate of rent at present, nearly \u00a3100 more than others.\r\nEarly in the tenancy the daughter\\'s husband would enter the property weekly provisionally to check the fire alarm (which was not done) and would check through all communal areas. Tenants were informed there was a cleaner who attended to communal areas weekly, there is no cleaner.\r\nThe tenants have all been asked in January whether they wished to retain their room next year, with the exception of one tenant. When this tenant found out and emailed the landlord to say the were undecided but would be able to confirm at least 2 months before the end of the tenancy, they were told their room was being advertised as they needed a firm response. This tenant received no formal notice that their contract is not being renewed but room viewings have already been arranged.\r\nIn general, the landlords and daughter have been difficult, unprofessional and rude. This is sad as the house itself is a good size and reasonably priced, it just is not worth the grief.","1301":"The main problem with this property is the lack of ventilation. There are only windows and a door at the front of the property which is completely glass fronted. The upshot is in the summer months it is unbearably hot.  We couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there.","1302":"Very nice property, suitable for a couple. Great connection to city centre via the tube, with the station literally 2 minutes from the flat.

Don\u2019t bother with this property, buying or renting.\n\r\nRats in the wall, a rat died and rotted and led us to shut off half of the flat for 3 weeks. Nightly scratching and nibbling next to your head in bed. Bonus cockroaches in winter.\n\r\nThe thudding bass from the hair dressers downstairs goes from 9am - 6\/9pm every day apart from Sunday and Monday. Lying in bed or on the sofa is impossible during these times. God forbid we had a child. The walls were vibrating before we taught the owner how to turn the bass down. But we still got woken up on a Saturday in bed by pop music most Saturday mornings. \n\r\nThe next door neighbours toilet window, and the Indian takeaways kitchen window, are both right next to the two bedroom windows. If you want your window open in summer, you\u2019ll fall asleep to the sound of clashing pans and yelling, be woken up by their end of work showers, and be woken the next morning by the horrible sounds of the very sweary and loud roommate taking his morning toilet trip. The extractor fan of the kitchen, also right next to the bedroom windows, means that the flat smells of curry 4pm until 11pm every day like clockwork. \n\r\nThe bus stop outside is an end of line, and during the summer buses run and rev their engines so hard that the living room fills with fumes and deafening noise.\n\r\nOur downstairs neighbours were plagued with black mould and soggy ceilings. Luckily we had no problems with this.\n\r\nCrossed wires on the payment meter for us and downstairs means that no one knows who owes what for electricity.

One set of windows opens from bottom to top and the other set opens from left to right. The actual opening is a very small square composed of the opening intersection of both sets of windows. This makes mold appear. One of the bedrooms and the living room are never ventilated properly (actually the living room has no windows that can be opened).\r\n- it would be nice if the bathroom would have a bathtub with a shower. Right now there is a transparent wall near the shower which makes it very difficult to reach the showerhead if you\\'re not actually in the shower.\r\n- window bathroom is also sealed and this encourages mold appearance very often\r\n- a factor that could improve reduced humidity inside the house, could be a tumble dryer, but after having a discussion with the Landlord and her brother (who was against the tumble dryer), they suggested that the laundry could be dried outside, near the house where you would normally park your car. So it\\'s either a car or clothes dried outside.\r\n- I would suggest that you ask to speak only to the Landlord (Lee Ann) and avoid discussions with her brother as he is a bit unaware of how the tenancy should be managed but has strong opinions. His suggestion was to clean up the leaves outside the property and put it in the Garden Waste bin, place it outside when the trash day is due and someone will collect it.  The Garden Waste collection, at least in Birmingham, works by having a subscription that costs 40 pounds\/year.

House spiders themselves aren\\'t an issue at all -  they don\\'t bite, they very, very rarely come out and when they do it\\'s super-easy to catch them and put them back in the basement.

She stole our side gate key to give to the builders without telling us, we noticed when we came back from holiday it had gone and didn\\'t tell us until we confronted her.

We\\'re talking about things like perished floor boards both upstairs and down stairs. Doors that wouldn\\'t shut, windows that you either couldn\\'t open because they were broken and wouldn\\'t shut after being open or windows that were broken so you couldn\\'t open them in the first place. There was a leak in the roof through the upstairs bedroom going into the dining room and the Landlord wouldn\\'t repair.  In the end the Estate agent made the arrangements and deducted it from his rent. By the time this happened there were mushrooms growing in the ceiling and mould in the walls.  This is still to be redecorated and remedied.\r\nWe were paying  \u00a3750 a month and the estate agent put the rent up to  \u00a3775 without telling us. When we complained they sent a letter saying the rent was going up to  \u00a3800 and they have since put the property on the market for  \u00a3825 even though the house is in need of complete redecoration. There are also cracks all over the house.","1392":"The property requires a major upgrade of the boiler\/heating. During our tenancy, it had an antiquated gravity system, with a water tank in the loft and an old boiler. The gravity system means very poor water pressure in the main bathroom (the en-suite has an extra water) pump. Heating also broke down twice during last year, once because of a faulty diverter valve, and the other time because of a boiler issue. The old boiler is coupled with a programmer for heating and hot water - cumbersome to use and quite inefficient in terms of higher energy bills. There was also a water leakage that took very long to find and fix.\n\r\nThe agents and the landlord made a completely unjustified claim on the deposit (a dispute is currently in progress) - they claimed cleaning costs north of \u00a3150 (we spent \u00a3225 on professional cleaners at the end of tenancy) and similar amount for something called \\\"rubbish removal\\\", which they didn\\'t explain what exactly it meant. The landlord also claimed \u00a3150 for broken blinds, even though the blinds were not new before the start of the tenancy and can\\'t be expected to last for too long.\n\r\nOverall, the response time by agents to maintenance issues was OK but because they needed to consult the landlord on everything, most of the issues took much longer to get fixed than would have been necessary otherwise. My advice to the landlord would be to invest into renovating plumbing and heating systems (like, upgrade to a combi boiler) in the property instead of replacing the windows and fixing the fascia - the tenants likely care much more about how it feels inside the property and can tolerate not-so-shiny looks from the outside but not when there\\'s no hot water and heating during the winter time.","1393":null,"1394":"One of the worst properties I\\'ve ever stayed in, landlord and landlords agent were always rude and unprofessional and would be very very slow in fixing things (only 1 thing fixed which was the water leak which came back again) and the rest they would just ignore and push out for months and months.

Room was sizeable for a flat but kitchen and bathroom have no windows, hence condensation and mould is a very big issue.

The landlord has refused to sort this out despite the bathroom wall started crumbling - however, they did give us permission to sort this out ourselves. \r\nIn December, the bathroom light started playing up. It would stay switched for a while (varies between seconds and minutes) and then would trip the light fuse causing the lights in the flat to go off.

However, rather than dealing with the issue (even when we told them we have asthma), the landlord made us wait 4 weeks to evaluate (after the leak was stopped). Then they waited another 2 weeks and simply wiped the mould away with vinegar (which left an unpleasant smell for a while). Then they said they won\\'t do anything until the summer even though behind the toilet, where the leak was, there is a large amount of mould.\n\r\nAdditionally, the furniture is very basic.

According to them, the landlord does not wish to cut further or remove the cupboard and hence, we will have to live with the issue during our tenancy or until they decide differently.

For example during viewing there was basic garden maintenance equipment in the shed (lawnmower and other items), at no point was it mentioned that this would be removed, yet move in and despite it being listed on the inventory it wasn\u2019t there.\n\r\nThe property suffers from severe noise and traffic pollution as the rear of the property backs onto the road to a busy Tescos, further Tesco delivery artic trucks park up opposite while queuing for their drop off at unsocial hours, with the engines on to power the chillers on the truck.\n\r\nThere is a very abusive and anti social resident living next door, her children often decide to walk down the passageway between the houses, however the passageway only provides access to my property.\n\r\nThe house has a driveway but the same problematic neighbours block my driveway constantly, instead of parking across or on their own drive.\n\r\nIt is a fairly high crime area, and I have been the victim of at least one attempted burglary whereby the rear gate of the property was attempted to be forced open.\n\r\nThe landlords are a nightmare to deal with, and I have been left with no heating at all when the temperatures were sub zero outside due to the unreliability of the heating, and poor quality insulation resulting in astronomical heating bills.  It appears that no work has ever been done to improve the insulation since the property was built in the 90s.\n\r\nThe property is opposite a residential nursing home for people with extreme learning disabilities so do expect lots of shouting and noise at all hours and that is far worse in summer whenever you have the windows open.\n\r\nNext door regularly park obscuring the driveway despite them having space for two cars on the drive.  Not so good when you need to get anywhere.\n\r\nThe concept of \u2018peaceful enjoyment of the property\u2019 is a concept unknown to the landlords, the same with visiting the property, and are known for visiting the property without any notice.  They have just randomly turned up at the property on multiple occasions.\n\r\nThe side access to the property is insecure as the landlords decided to cut the entire gate closure mechanism off mid tenancy, therefore the property is far less secure and that anyone could gain access to the rear and side of the property at any time they want.\n\r\nWhen you point out the unlawful actions of the landlords they retaliate by making malicious and false police reports, I suspect to try to create grounds to evict, however as expected, as I had not in fact done anything wrong that the matter was closed with no action.\n\r\nI have had to make police reports in my time at living at the property for burglary and criminal damage, noise nuisance complaints to the council, and now complaints for the landlords harassment.\n\r\nIn my time at the property the landlords rent the property out by a professional agent, however that is where professionalism comes to an end, as the landlords then try to manage the property themselves and are fairly clueless as to their legal obligations as a landlord and will visit the property without any notice.\n\r\nIn summary, if you enjoy noise, problematic neighbours, landlords who make malicious false reports to police, shouting and screaming from a nursing home, crime, children playing on your driveway, your car being blocked in on your own driveway, fumes and traffic noise from the local Tesco then this property is ideal! If you wish for a peaceful and enjoyable property, one in which the heating works, one with reasonable landlords then look elsewhere!","1421":"TL;DR - New landlord (Sep 2015) rescued this property from rubbish landlord. Could not recommend current landlord in this property enough! Throughout my years of renting, he is the most helpful, decent and caring landlord who made sure the flat was \\\"habitable in the highest standards\\\" and ensured health & safety of his tenants were priority. Any problems (i.e. no water, he fixed straightaway. Like immediately!). He lets out properties in Kingston & Canary Wharf - whoever rents from him is lucky as he does look after you if any issues. Worth the money.\n\r\nI moved into this property in July 2013. The location is excellent, 2 minutes walk to the station, 5 minutes walk to the town centre & riverside and countless bus stations to destinations like Heathrow, Wimbledon, Putney, Hampton Court, etc., so very accessible. \n\r\nBack then, we had a really terrible landlord (will now be referred to as TL). When the room was let out, it was dusty and the curtain rails were not attached to the wall properly. There was also live wiring from a light fitting socket which was left in the room. We also had constant problems with having no water which took at least a week to fix, and this happened several times throughout 2013-early 2015. When he was in the process of selling the property, he also did not inform tenants the estate agents were coming over which resulted in viewings unknown to the tenants and agents bursting into our room. I had learnt that from one of the tenants when she moved out that TL had not even protected the deposit! \n\r\nTHIS ALL CHANGED in the 2nd half of 2015 when we acquired our new landlord (will now be referred to as NL). NL messaged existing tenants to arrange a meeting and to check everything is okay with the flat. He arranged for an electrician to sort our exposed live wire in one of the rooms and made sure that all electrics were safe and not in danger of bursting into flames. He also made sure that any damages (such as unsecured, hanging curtain rail) in the room was fixed. NL made sure that the existing tenants were living in a good condition flat. When we had no water again, he was immediately around to fix it. The issue has not occurred since! We signed new contracts with him, all paperwork were clear and if anything looked after the tenants interest. An email followed shortly from mydeposits.co.uk (a government authorised tenancy deposit protection scheme) to confirm that our deposits are now protected. NL already 5* service and he\\'s only just taken over the property at this point! A year on, just before I left, we had a problem with the washing machine. Again, as quick as Flash, he was around there to check it out and have it fixed to make sure we could use it ASAP. \n\r\nI\\'m so grateful to NL that he has looked after me as a tenant. A year & few months on, I have moved out and even then he made sure move out process was okay & deposit quickly returned after inspection. \n\r\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CURRENT LANDLORD AT THIS PROPERTY.

They served us a section 21 as we didn\\'t agree to a rent increase, they didn\\'t even bother to discuss with us directly and went straight to hiding behind the letting agent. The reason we didn\\'t agree to a rent increase was because they left us, during the coldest part of winter when it was hitting -5 overnight, without a properly working boiler for over 1 month. They kept sending the plumber to try and fix it in the cheapest way possible and in the meantime offered us no alternatives such as space heaters. It costs us a fortune to buy and run them to keep ourselves just a little more than freezing. They never even apologised, just expected a big thanks when they finally replaced it and even lied about how much they spent on the new boiler for reasons unknown. So after serving us notice they then have the audacity to come and measure up for a new kitchen for the new tenants whilst we were still there. Then came getting the deposit back when we left, which we did well within the notice period and without fuss, even leaving the place frankly cleaner than it was when we moved in. We chased and chased for our deposit, as did the letting agent (supposedly), as did the deposit scheme. They completely ignored everything meaning we were out of pocket over 1k for over 2 months until the deposit scheme sent it back to us.

The carpets in the lounge and hall were at least thirty years old, the kitchen units were of the same age and there was no cooker. There was also a shortage of electric sockets, only one in the kitchen. I was not concerned as the landlord agreed to my bringing my two giant dogs and the cat. He did put in fencing at the back and side, especially for the dogs, which I appreciated. I had to put the fence on the other side in myself. \n\r\nThe radiators did not turn off individually so I found I was heating rooms I was not using; the heating system was very dated and inefficient. However, the problems I had with the landlord were mostly with the boiler and the drains. Nobody told me that an oil boiler, if allowed to run right out, would not light again. The landlord did repairs himself and was very aggressive, insisting that I had been told about this; I hadn\\'t. I was there for two and a half years and the boiler was never serviced. \n\r\nThe drains blocked within two weeks of my moving in. I was told the landlords wouldn\\'t pay to clear them as they were checked before I moved in. The plumber who came, at my expense, said it was just normal sewage. A few weeks later, the drains blocked again. This time I got Dynorod, again at my expense, who said the problem was caused by the pipes being diverted from a cesspit to the main sewer. Every time the landlord visited for anything, he checked the drains, but still denied there was a problem with them. When I left he tried to claim \u00a3100 for blocked drains, although they were certainly not blocked when I left. He lied about that, saying I had been putting baby wipes down there; I hadn\\'t. He also denied that I had permission to keep a cat and said he didn\\'t know about the cat, despite having seen her several times. I asked the agent when I moved in about the animals being included on the lease and was told it wasn\\'t necessary because I had paid extra deposit for them.\n\r\nWhen the landlords asked to come with double glazing people to put new windows in the bedrooms, I agreed and a date was settled. However, my vacuum broke two days before and I had not been able to vacuum. I explained this to the landlord rather than postpone the date (for his benefit) but with two very hairy dogs naturally there were dog hairs. The Dyson repair man came that day and I was able to vacuum, but still the landlord complained to the agent the following day about dog hairs. He also spent the time the glazing people were there going into all the rooms and nosing about.\n\r\nI am a 68 year old widow living alone and I found it very uncomfortable to have the landlord doing all repairs, rather than a qualified specialist, and I found his attitude bullying and intimidating. \n\r\nThe Deposit Protection service used by the agent had complicated rules for reclaiming my money, useless to anyone without the internet. They allowed the landlord to put in a claim after the deadline, so that was fourteen days lost. I was not shown the evidence he eventually put in at the last minute, but was told if I wanted to see it I would have to ask for an extension. I then had to wait 28 days before they agreed a division of the deposit, despite it being evident from the evidence produced at the beginning. To find out how anything was progressing, I had to phone up.","1431":null,"1432":"Very good property with a fantastic landlord managing it","1433":"Flat is renovated and looks good but not high standards is used for renovation.

He would not get repairs done promptly. There was a persistent water leak from the cistern in the ensuite bathroom. He said he would investigate it but it took him more than 12 months to do so and then he tried to shrug away the problem dismissing the accrued \u00a31400 excess water bill. We accepted a settlement of \u00a31000 although it was wholly his fault for dithering and delaying the repair. There was also a loose kitchen tap that took him over 2 years to fix. He came around with a spanner and was not secured properly. \r\nBarry King is an unethical person to deal with, taking advantage of our vulnerable situation. My elderly and unwell father rented his flat at 11 Oadtrin lodge for over 5 years but his greed to cash in at a difficult time for us at the end of the tenancy reflected his inhumane and heartless character. At the end of the tenancy, he also had the audacity to enter and redecorate the flat without our permission before the handover.

This combination gave me very bad health problems for the entire year.\n\r\nOn top of that, when we moved out, the landlord told us we could leave any rubbish we had out the front, and the handyman would take it to the skip for us free of charge, as he going that way anyway.

Most of the tenants in the building are unhappy due to the landlord, the noise and the way she deals with problems. We had mice and also had abusive neighbours. Neighbour threatened us on multiple occasions and tried to force his way into our property (resulting in his arrest). The neighbour is actually the landlords nephew, as her sister owns the properties next door. She lied to us and said they don\\'t speak, but this is clearly untrue as the neighbour continued to threaten us after speaking with our landlord. Whilst she assured us they moved out, he was still returning to the property and causing trouble - banging on doors and demanding entry into number 3. Police were called multiple times during our tenancy. Noise is so bad and we could hear the neighbours shouting at 3am and the Tennant upstairs walking around and talking at all hours. Neighbours on the other side used to play music until 3am until a number of noise complaints stopped this. Strongly advise tennants to avoid this property at all costs - unpleasant landlord who made our last year absolute hell. Totally unprofessional and confrontational.","1452":"Very small and narrow terraced house, which would suit 1 or 2 people comfortably but not designed for family living.

Also has a small yappy dog that barks every time you move in your own house. The school across the road causes lots of parking issues, constantly being blocked in driveway because of inconsiderate parking such as people parking on both sides of the road and on both sides of driveways so cannot even get out.

The oven wasn\\'t cleaned, the letting agents had covered up a hole in the floor with a doormat, the cupboards in the kitchen were unfinished, there was a massive hole in the wall where they had excavated to make a drain pipe for the sink, but never bothered filling up, poor quality finish in the bathroom, for starters. To boot, the landlord claimed that the property had been \u2018newly renovated\u2019 (see pictures).\n\r\nThe first year, the rent was \u00a3675 (which is what we bid while the property was to let at \u00a3650). \r\nUpon requesting a contract renewal for the second year, and that we be allowed to take our cat with us, the landlord(s) informed us there would be a \u00a320 rent raise for that reason, up to \u00a3695. \r\nUpon enquiring about a contract renewal for another year, the landlord informed us the property was now being valued at \u00a3760 a month, and as such he would up the rent to \u00a3730.\r\nAll this was still fine, but in the same mail I had requested permission to paint a decorative pattern around the door and do some maintenance on the wall behind the stove (all this out of my own pocket). \r\nHe informed me off the bat he would be happy to let me redo the wall behind the stove, but after several back and forward mails (including me complaining about not being allowed to decorate the property I intended to live in), he told me they \\\"weren\\'t comfortable\\\" letting me paint any patterns.\r\nTaking that as a red flag, my fiance and I handed in our letter of notice.\n\r\nThis is nothing new, as when we asked him to fix the sink after the plug had fallen through, he replied that it was \\'due to a lack of cleaning\\'. When I offered to remove the old wooden deck which was starting to rot, he had no qualms whatsoever. Definitely a landlord who is more worried about the betterment of his property than the quality of life of his tenants. \n\r\nAs a first time tenant, I would seriously advise against moving into this property or at least under this landlord, unless you intend to live in it doing anything to the property at all (except if it benefits the landlord, ofcourse.)","1463":"This is a good size flat in a good location, closed to transport links. It has plenty of natural light and heats well during the winter. However, the location is also extremely noisy, with cars going by at all hours including ambulances at night (due to proximity to St Mary\\'s Hospital). Furthermore, the Waitrose supermarket next door also attracts a lot of people, including beggars, who tend to be quite loud until very late at night. \r\nWhatever good aspects the flat has they are completely undermined by the landlord. She is totally and completely unresponsive, very rude and unpolite. The landlord clearly does not care about the property and will go above and beyond to not fulfil her responsibilities. When you request anything from her, everything takes an extra long time or is left undone. For example: she will not reply to any emails or texts, only when she needs something. Another example, the oven is from 2001 and when the door latch finally gave up she refused to fix it. She also got upset when we asked her to fix the heaters that were not working during winter. \r\nThe real state agent, the porter and the handyman they all complain about her and her level of rudeness and how unhelpful she can be. \r\nTo be quite honest you can find a very good and nice property around the area, for the same price, and save your self the headache.

After the report was completed the estate agent asked for it to be amended to include pictures of debris in the garden from two bean bags we had left in the back alleyway to be removed by the bin men and some scratches to wooden floor in hallway which is not in a good state of repair. Fair enough, (my husband) perhaps we shouldn\\'t have left the bean bags relying on the bin men to take but we should have been notified and asked to clear ourselves. \n\r\nThe invoice submitted for their claim from the deposit scheme mostly covered repairing the back door which didn\\'t work before we moved in and a bench which was also broken.

We rented 15 Buchan Street, Hamilton and the owner of the letting agent was actaully the owner of the property, although he has registered with the Landlord Registration using a company name, Excel Property. When we moved in the garden was in an appalling state. There were bits of cars, rotten carpets, broken glass, branches, rubble and all manner of other junk lying in it. The trees were overgrown and when a branch fell off one destroying a section of the next door neighbour\\'s fence the owner of the property and owner of Concept Property, denied that he was responsible for the upkeep of the garden to him. After the letting agency failed to deal with the mess in the garden we ended up cleaning the garden and removing the rubbish ourselves. The house had problems with mold and dampness. At first I put the almost clownish incompetency of the owner and his staff as being down to laziness or inexperience but I saw the nasty side of the owner when he failed to answer emails requesting repairs and acted in a dishonest manner on several occasions. My son has Autism and PICA, to our horror we found out that the property had lead contaminated paint and soil. There was paint flaking off the old wooden frames of the single glazed windows. My son ate some of this contaminated decayed wood, and other exposed paint, leading to there being high levels of lead in his blood and it is probably that he has suffered brain damage. It was impossible to watch him the whole time as we have other children and an unpleasant email from the Letting Agency suggested that it was our fault that he had lead poisoning due to us not having taken proper care of him! When the windows were eventually replaced, the owner of the letting agency\/house assured us that this would be done safely but instead Doherty arranged for this to be done as cheaply as possible by his handyman. Health and Safety guidelines were not followed and our health was put at risk, my wife was expecting at the time. On several occasions emails highlighting the need for repairs were ignored by the letting agent. We were reminded twice that the house was cheaper than other properties in the area, suggesting that we should just put up with the poor state of the house. Our rent was put up a few times in spite of the poor overall condition of this property with no central heating. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this letting agency as they were extremely incompetent and the stress of dealing with them is not worth it. This letting agency is very unprofessional and I fear that other families may have experienced similar problems with Concept Property Letting Ltd.

They sent one but never collected the old one as they claimed it had bed bugs! We never suffered from anything, but, when I checked for signs of bed bugs I found traces. The agency accused me of bringing bed bugs into the property and they threatened that if I don\\'t bring any company to clean up they will take it off my deposit!!! I got terrified until I got super lucky by meeting the previous tenant who came to collect his post. He told me that they struggled with bed bugs and they brought a company three times to solve the issue! So it turned out that nothing was thrown out post to treatment of infestation and hence the signs all over the bed.

Over the winter, when windows were more often closed, this was unmanageable. We had significant damage to our clothes due to mold growth in wardrobes. The landlady did her best to help us out, buying us mold killer and cat litter to act as a dessicant, but it was a losing battle. \n\r\nHeating - Boiler was pretty unreliable. Once leaked and caused damage to the flat below. However, property usually stayed warm even when was heating off.\n\r\nSafety - Area usually felt very safe during the day. However, the area is a stark mix of very affluent houses and council estates and was very quiet late at night so walking alone late didn\\'t feel comfortable.

On further questioning I found out that this is actually because they have no way of contacting the owners, and their go to person is the accountant who doesn\\'t really seem to have a say in anything.

The kitchen is pretty poor, with the units and work surface being taking inspiration or just straight from a 70\\'s house. On departure we had a professional company come in who did a great job, however the landlords were trying to find anything they could to try and get as much extra money out of us as they could. The interior quality is very poor with paint pealing off of the door frames (they had painted over oil based paint with water based paint, god knows why you would do that), the kickboards in the kitchen were loose ever since we moved in and were never fixed despite requests being made.

At the end I had to change the heat setting for the water on the boiler every time I used it, ie on low to have a shower, because if you added cold water when in the shower, it went completely cold and then hot to wash up. Even at the hottest I could still wash up comfortably, ie it was not hot enough to kill germs and I had to change the water 3 times for one lot of washing up. The water was also not hot enough to have a bath in the winter, not that you would want to there because it was so cold. They maintained they didn\\'t know how bad the boiler was... The bathroom also does not have a radiator, they put a blow heater in but that doesn\\'t help in the dead of winter when you go to the loo in the middle of the night.

We spent days keeping food in the garden. The landlady was painfully slow to respond to any problems we ever had. To be fair, we lived there for 4 years and initially experienced few problems with the property. Nonetheless, as evidenced above, when the problems began to occur, the lack of fixing was woeful.","1606":"The agency looking after this property is called George Adams. Avoid at all costs.

The agency ignored emails and didn\\'t deal with any of the problems at all. If you decide to go with this agency, be aware that you will not be looked after.","1607":"The property and amenities are of sufficient quality. Unfortunately the problem is the communication and with the landlord as no agent is involved. The landlord can be very aggressive and abrupt often directing tenants to deal with issues such as broken oven\/toilet\/door handle yourself and \\'re-imbursing\\' you, which has never happened. On wanting to leave the flat and move onto another place the landlord has time and time again been very difficult to get deposit back from and does not store it in a deposit protection scheme. He claims that this is because we are lodgers, not tenants despite him living in Thailand, not even the same country. \r\nBeware of this property!","1608":"The one bed is on the top floor directly under the eaves of the roof.

Broken security system means anyone can enter the buildings, steal parcels and walk up right to our apartment door. Post room for parcels taken away, things breaking and no fix in sight due to lack of money doesn\u2019t even cover all things. The flat itself, like a lot in this complex, has wool carpets that have brought on moths which are still appearing after pest control. Landlord is washing their hands of the issues in the complex and asking for rent increase that is laughable as the flat does not reflect the asking rent price. Don\u2019t entertain renting here and look at the many other flat buildings in Manchester and Salford that offer much better value for similar money.","1614":"The kitchen is not meeting the health and safety , too small and no working board available .

She would never let you say anything and just start screaming. I developed anxiety issues because of her behaviour. I asked her niece- so our landlady- for help and she said her behaviour was my fault because I made a mess.

There have been a lot of violent incidents, police comes few times per week, lot of drug and alcohol abuse. The area is very unsafe, main residents are people from African origin or Brazilian.","1620":"Landlord would never get jobs done, and the ones he did weren\\'t ever done properly, just substandard , he would tell \\'workmen\\' to bodge rather than fix the problem properly, also tried to blackmail us on more than one occasion.

It was lovely to have the garden, living room and large kitchen for communal areas, and the semi-converted loft space is very useful for storage. Parking is almost always available and the neighborhood is very family oriented and safe. Very quiet neighborhood, a short walk into town. The landlord was attentive and always helped with requests where possible. The deposit return was excellent, and he used a DPS scheme. Excellent value for money.","1623":"This tenancy was introduced by an estate agency. However that was the only role the agency played apart from towards the end of our stay to retrieve our deposit. In the duration of our stay, we had to deal with landlord, who was not responsive. Initially we did have a decent experience, but as days past by they did not care about our calls with regards to addressing our issues with the house. Sometimes the landlord would turn-up uninvited and ask for a random inspection of the house. We had to complain the letting agency about this. Our relation with the landlord turned sour after a year\\'s stay when they used rude & abusive language, that\\'s when we decided to move out. Thanks that we had the letting agency between us so we got a part of our deposit back, else we would not have got any. Overall I\\'d say, if you wish to stay here, please make sure you rent it via a good agency who will understand your views and concerns as the landlord is not helpful.","1624":null,"1625":"The property itself was very dated, the carpets were old and many of the electrical fittings were old and potentially dangerous. The upstairs shower leaked into the kitchen numerous times, causing the electricity to cut out. The landlord took a while to fix this issue, claiming he didn\\'t want to spend the  money to replace the shower - as we had a second shower downstairs. The issue was eventually fixed after months of not using the upstairs shower, using sealant, which will most probably be an issue in the near future unless the base of the shower is replaced. The heating also broke during our tenancy, but the landlord failed to fix this issue before our tenancy end date, due to it being the summer (heating is not necessary). Despite the long list of issues, the landlord replied to our texts promptly and the house is in a great location for university students and in a nice area.","1626":null,"1627":"We loved living here. The location is great - right next to the river with amazing view of Canary Wharf. Its quiet and the rent was reasonable. We had a few problems with the property while we were there - a broken boiler, water leak and broken storage heater. All these problems were rectified extremely quickly by the letting agent however. We were sad to leave and only moved out because of a change of job. We had no problem with return of the deposit.","1628":"Check-in process was a disaster as the agents hadn\\'t done anything that was agreed in the contract and was legally binding (carpet replacement, new beds new dining table, wall painting), not even a proper clean-up.\r\nWe had huge issues with a wall full of humidity and mould which was ready to fall apart and took months to fix after constantly chasing the estate agents without any result. This was a real health hazard for the first 8-9 months until the leak was fixed (after even having snails on the wall) and the wall was redone. There are still signs of humidity building back as colder weather starts.\r\nThe team of estate agents changed after the initial team had failed at doing anything from check-in to fixing the wall issue to responding in a timely manner. The new team is much better on all aspects.\r\nThe landlord could be a bit more appreciative of the good condition the house is kept in and then fact that rent is paid in advice bi-annually. \r\nThe structure of the house is poor with the floors not being even and therefore furniture cannot stand straight. The floor and walls also tremble when a big track passes by on the road.\r\nAny furniture in the house is of very poor quality (including sofas and beds), there was no coffee table although the house was advertised as fully-furnished.","1629":"Within 1 day of moving in the toilet came away from the wall flooding the kitchen with waste. I had to call a plumber myself as landlord was interested. The door frame was rotten and took months to repair. The kitchen window fell out and the landlord was again uninterested. It has plastic sheet over it for 3 months until it was eventually replaced and the other windowframes were glossed over instead of being replaced even though they were rotting. Quite often the heating would stop due to water pressure issues. N the end I gave up asking the landlord.","1630":"The landlord company has a maintenance team which seems to be very unreliable. WE were supposed to get the flat painted, and when we got there it wasn\\'t (they had painted a single wall of a room) and there was damage from hooks\/nails in a lot of places. They took several weeks to do that (with all our stuff in). That included some no shows from the maintenance people and some times of them getting in without notice and without our permission. This is just an example but there have been other around electrical, appliances, etc, and we\\'ve just been 1 month in.","1631":null,"1632":"This property needs refurbishment, it was painted prior to my arrival but the paint job is very poor, streaky and no real prep was done so chips easily.  The window sills are flaking internally and externally.  \n\r\nThe building was flooded badly 4 months after I moved in, the building is not maintained very well, and a birds nest in a gully was not removed despite notifying the management company that water was coming in, so it turned into a major ordeal with collapsed ceilings in other flats in the building, damage everywhere, unnecessary. \n\r\nA new boiler was installed 3 months before I moved in but it is a very cheap model and has already needed repairs under warranty.  I have got a leak in the shower wall, which was also quite new.  Unfortunately the landlords don\\'t spend on the property so it is declining into disrepair and neglect.  Shame because it is otherwise a very pretty flat.  \n\r\nI will leave as soon as my lease expires, the constant issues (especially water issues) worry me and make it difficult to relax and enjoy my time here.","1633":"There is a tube and national rail track underneath \/ adjacent to the building. High noise levels (particularly noticeable at night). The building also vibrates when trains run by. The agent managing the property has not been responsive (asked to moved out earlier even paying whatever cost and he did not answer). Cracks appearing in the property. Common areas are dirty as there is no housekeeping - same with the common garden.","1634":"A decent sized terrace house, decorated tastefully with white walls and wooden flooring and neutral carpets\/tiles.

And quite often you have to park your car away from the house. Rubbish is an issue, as being a house share property with 5 adults and only 1 black bin, it does tend to pile up, even with recyling.

We never asked for anything from this landlord when we lived there. I do not recommend this flat to anyone.","1646":"Unfortunately I can\\'t state my true living period in this property from the dates available on here but I was in this property from July 2010 to end of March 2014. My sister and her boyfriend stayed on for another 4 months. I originally moved in with my sister and her boyfriend moved in with us in 2013. We were first under the impressed that our letting agent was just that, everytime we mentioned seeing if the landlord could sort something, he told us the landlord didn\\'t want to deal with the property so we took it as it was a simple buy to let. We later learnt the letting agent was in fact our registered landlord and that he had bought the property barely a few weeks before we viewed it so when we asked at the viewing about whether it had damp, he clearly stated to us it didn\\'t which there was no way he would have known for sure. The flat had been recently redecorated which we also realised cover a multitude of sins and the decoration, although very lovely and neutral, was in no way practical. The bathroom initially had no tiles apart from a very small section and instead had what the letting agent\/landlord said was \\\"expensive waterproof wallpaper\\\". The hallway had plush cream carpet which is not practical and got dirty very easily and the limo in the kitchen was fitted poorly so got accidentally ripped in a few sections. After the first winter, we discovered we had a serious case of rising damp. Of course you only discover damp in the winter time, but it was so bad that prior to a trip back home for Christmas, I discovered it had caused mould inside my wardrobe (which was against an outside wall) and ruined many items of clothing, jewellery (Inc sentimental, irreplaceable items), bags and shoes. The wardrobe had to be moved to the only internal wall that wasn\\'t effected by mould. I should at this point mention that the layout of the flat had been altered previously and my bedroom had previously been the kitchen and had boxed in pipes running through my room from the bathroom nextdoor. That is where the main mould was. I knew it was to do with these pipes but the landlord insisted it was poor ventilation caused by closed windows and damp coming from wet clothes hung in the kitchen and in my sister\\'s room. I always had my bedroom window open during the day and so was the bathroom window (even though due to the design and it being a ground floor flat, it posed a serious security issue), and the rooms in which wet laundry were hung were not well ventilated yet they had no problems with mould or damp. We eventually fought to get the rest of the wall in the bathroom tiled after the wallpaper went black, though we had to buy the tiles and equipment and it was my step dad who came up and tiled it (we\\'d had small part tiled by the landlord but not enough to do anything). We continued to complain about the mould especially as my health was starting to suffer, but after getting an expert in apparently we didn\\'t have a problem. Eventually I moved out to my own place, but once I was gone the flat still was deteriorating. After my sister and her boyfriend handed in their notice, the landlord finally decided to do something about the damp. Except he decided to rip out the entire bathroom minus the toilet whilst they were still living there. Because this made the flat inhabitable, they had to stay in a nearby premier inn before they got early entry to their new property. We also had an issue with the landlord charging us admin fees for the first 2 years we were there until my sister\\'s boyfriend pointed out that this was now illegal in Scotland; if he hadn\\'t pointed this out we\\'d had been paying extra money than we should have been. We also were plagued with spiders and centipedes due to the damp. The boiler also leaked so bad at one point that the gas engineer said we could\\'ve easily have had a carbon monoxide leak. Things were just not fixed or sorted in a reasonable space of time and we were blamed for absolutely everything that went wrong with the property. We also had a small fight on our hands to get our full deposit back, which we did eventually but not until we threatened legal action.","1647":null,"1648":null,"1649":"The property isn\\'t bad except the fact has light carpet straight from the entrance into the room which needs to be cleaned quite often.The room\/studio is for one person only.There is no canopy at the door which means on rainny days get\\'s messy and wet.Thanks God I had my professional carpet cleaner machine and I bought a canopy.\r\nAww one more thing...there is no storage whatsoever and the room is quite small for storage stuff.\n\r\nMy main issue was with the landlords.Yeah ...there are two of them.I dealt with one of them most of the time and all of the sudden the other contacts you with same matter...it\\'s really confusing.Did I mentioned they are husband and wife?\n\r\nI had bad experience with both of them.Took ages to sign the contract becouse needed some details modified.\r\nFor any matter I use to send a message like today and receive a reply within days.\n\r\nDuring the first lockdown I explain my situation to my landlord, not working, I was struggling...but even though, I told him I\\'ll pay half of my rent which I did...after few days he ask me when xan I pay the rest?

Work would also be done on the weekend, despite being told that all tenants are home on the weekend and would kindly like to not be disturbed - those wishes were not considered.","1664":"This property was sold by previous landlord at auction with my family as sitting tenants, the new landlord never viewed the property prior to buying it.\r\nWhen ever there is an issue it gets the worse possible stage before anything is done, the toilet was leaking upstairs, when the landlord finally came he rocked it said it was fine and left,, the leak continued and a few month\\'s later after hearing a loud rumble and crashing sound went downstairs to the kitchen below where the toilet is to find a huge hole in the ceiling, that stayed like that until i had to call in the rent assessment panel as the landlord was asking for a massive increase in rent the hole was fixed before the visit and the outside had it\\'s first lick of paint for years.\r\nWhen it rains hard water leaks into an attic bedroom, also a back bedroom it runs along the ceiling and drips out of the light fitting, there is mould  in a back attic room so would not allow anyone to stay in there.\r\nAlso had to get environmental health in due to the above plus the lack of electric sockets in each room the lack of double glazing and central heating means it is very cold( severe cold as EHO stated) also the electricity power board in the cellar is over 40 years old as is the wiring and requires fuse wire if the circuit was to become overloaded.\r\nThe landlord stated to the rent panel every year that the improvement work notice was done and signed off to EHO satisfaction which is totally amazing as 1, the work still hasn\\'t been carried out some 7 years later and we are still waiting for the EHO to return from 2 weeks holiday that again started 7 years ago.\r\nSo now that the landlord has been given a \u00a3145 per week rent increase by the rent panel i am engaging the help from my MP and EHO in the hope that this time the work will actually be carried out.\r\nIf this property ever becomes vacant i would advise steering well clear even if it is refurbished up to a modern standard as the landlord wants his rent but wants to do nothing in return.","1665":null,"1666":null,"1667":"Absolutely beautifully kind elderly couple who rent out this flat, however during our time there it was a pretty grim, dark and damp basement flat.

The check in and check our procedures were easy and he was upfront and fair about our deposit. The flat is super clean (when we left it in 2017 anyway) and of a high specification. The neighbors are quiet and friendly and the block in general is clean and full of well-mannered people.

However, there is a constant leak from roof when it rains hard. I am not sure where the water is leading to, but it passes through the underground of flat 37. When you step on flooring, water appears on the floor and your socks will get wet.\r\nUnfortunately, there are signs of leakage all over the building. I am not sure if this is a serious problem for other flats and the whole building but for me, it is a serious issue. Black mould has started growing and if you are going to rent this flat in future, then check out the woodwork around the floor in the wardrobe and bathrooms, make sure they are brand new as at the moment, they are all wasted due to leak. There is an also clear distance in the flooring (about 1cm between clocks). If you see such distances, look closely inside them, you may notice moisture there.\r\nIf we deduce the leakage and the rumbling noise of the rooftop, it is superb. You will neven feel cold thanks to small size flats and well designed central heating systems that works with Gas. \r\nIt is really a shame that the building management is not looking after the building as it should. it is a waste of asset.\r\nI would recommend the flat only if you inspect the flat on your viewing to make sure there is no leakage.","1690":null,"1691":"The property itself was lovely, definitely the nicest I have ever experienced.  However unfortunately the time the landlord took to undertake repairs was not what I would have expected at such a nice property.  It took 3 weeks for the landlord to arrange repair to washing machine that then took 3 further visit to fix which meant I had not washing machine for 6 weeks and no apology no compensation nothing, then to further complicate things months later it would appear a slow leak was caused by the rough handling of the repair men !!.  \r\nBathroom ceiling leak seemed to go on for an age before someone repaired the leak but not the staining to the ceiling.  \n\r\nJust a shame as really did enjoy living here.","1692":"Given the price charges for rent, this is a very good property. It consists of two houses merged into one and each room is converted into a small studio room. Most have a kitchen area. Some have a private shower room, some use a shared shower room. Mine actually had a full size bathroom for my own private use but this was accessed by a communal corridor outside the flat.\n\r\nThe managing agents are very professional and fix most problems much sooner than other landlords\/agents I have had.

Would turn up unannounced, verbally assaulted me on multiple occasions over the phone and in person. When I moved out I discovered she never registered my deposit with the government protection scheme (which is illegal). After a week she made the transfer (with a nasty reference I may add). I had bailiffs show up due to unpaid council tax prior to my lease starting which she then attempted to extort from me, leaving me no option but to have my parents talk to her. \r\nI have rented many properties across the country but have never experienced this from a landlord.\r\nI am reviewing this property as a warning for the next tenant as this is completely unacceptable behaviour from a landlord who clearly is suffering from mental health issues.

The house doesn\\'t hold heat, which for a new build is as disappointing, as it is expensive. Having lived in a caravan before, I noticed very little difference between this house and a caravan (which can be found in accommodation ads for half my current rent).\r\nThe sewage air vent is on the roof and my kitchen has recently a strong sewage smell coming from the lower kitchen cupboards, which, for some reason have plumbing pipes in them. This latest incident is just one of many, the house was built by cowboys.\r\nThe incinerator, which can be seen from the living room, is now fully operational and is belching out toxic materials 24\/7, unfortunately the area and every living thing, is now being contaminated and black smoke can be seen at night, which is worrying, as the emissions, we were told, would be white.

This property comes with the passive aggressive type who is in fact, only the &#34;son&#34; of the landlord. I never met the landlord in my time there. I found out only in the last year of our term that it is the son who collects the rent for his parents who live abroad somewhere in the Middle East. In the first 4 years we dealt with the excellent Gold Snapes who had the tricky job of dealing with the &#34;Son&#34; of the landlord. We did not realise how tricky he was until Gold Snapes closed and we were consequently forced to deal with the son directly. In the year that followed, and our last, we found his constant showing up unexpectedly, loitering when workmen are sent to fix problems, and aggressive attitude on rent hikes too much and were forced to move on. \n\r\nDuring our stay we experienced the frequent occurrence of general waste blockages, rodent infestations, numerous heating issues, reoccurring electrical faults, damp, moulded walls, waste pipe blockages due to poor plumbing and gas leaks more than most properties we have ever stayed in.

Before moving in the walls in the shower were mouldy - black around the tiles, one of the tenants removed them and cleaned it out properly. There was one door which nobody could close, promised to be fixed - never happened, windows being closed, promised to get the keys to open them - never happened-, a cut-out piece from a carpet, saying it\\'s not a problem - claiming money from deposit to fix it-. The letting agent disappeared after signing the contract, the landlord didn\\'t provide any contact info about the letting agency or a new letting agent. The landlord wanted to raise the rent giving less then 1 week notice, he also wanted to charge us by 100\u00a3 for making a new contract, although the original one allowed to continue the tenancy after the first 6 months with the same conditions - which was absolutely fine with the tenants-. During the tenancy period, there were mice and slugs several times in the house. Asked the contact information of the agency from the landlord several times, no answer, at the end the tenants had to deal with these issues on their own and were not reimbursed for expenses. The landlord took a visit a couple of times during the tenancy period but not informed always us about the visit. The last month a new agent showed the flat for future tenants, came in without any nocite - 1 day before the visit they or the landlord have to inform the tenants about the visit, that didn\\'t happened all the time-.  Finishing the tenancy the landlord was claiming money for allegedly caused damages like the unfinished kitchen surface - which was in the same condition before the move-in, the repair of the unclosable door and the cut-out carpet.","1719":"You will deal predominantly with the landlady, who is always courteous and can be reached by telephone or email.  For a short period I was unable to reach her, although this later turned out to be because she had somehow, accidentally, blocked me on her mobile phone.  The landlords are conscientious, and on one occasion, when I had dropped the ball in terms of upkeep of the property, let me know politely, via a letter.  When I let them know about my concerns about the heating and extractor fan, these issues were fixed quickly and without fuss by the landlords.\n\r\nThe property can get a bit cold, and would be better with double glazing.  In addition, whilst I was living there, one of the residents upstairs had a habit of getting stoned and playing incredibly loud classical music on any given night of the week, into very unreasonable hours (3 or 4 o clock).  I managed to get by using some good silicon ear plugs, but it would be reasonable to confront her about it.\n\r\nAll in all a positive experience, offroad parking is good.  Main drawbacks are the cold, and the very noisy neighbour, she may have moved, however I suspect she was a long term fixture in the building.","1720":"Recommend if you don\\'t mind party noises from neighbours.\r\nLandlord is very helpful.","1721":null,"1722":"If you don\\'t have time to read this, all you need to know is that REIGN were so rapacious that I was invited to talk about my experiences on BBC Radio One. I am aware that sounds unbelievable, but I have nothing to gain from lying, I only present the truth that has been suppressed for so long. Perhaps reading through the disaster I went through with REIGN, it will make sense why!\n\r\nNightmare from beginning to the end.\r\nLiving in a Reign property for two years caused constant stress and anxiety day after day and I wish I had been able to leave earlier.\r\nNever a day went by without something going wrong. \r\nEveryone I had over to my flat would comment on how grim the building is and I noticed that the majority of the people living here are students, first-time renters, poor families and people who are new to the UK. Of course. It\\'s people like us who are seen as easy money.\r\nI have warned all my friends and family to never rent from Reign and they all agreed on seeing the state of the building they never would.\r\nSome of these issues were to do with the building I lived with rather than my flat. So I asked Reign if there is a number for the building manager. They said no such number exists and I found myself that was a lie. So I think it\\'s only fair to mention those issues here too since they didn\\'t direct me to anyone who could fix them.\r\nThere is no review page for the building owners but that would be B.hive property\/APW who are also partially responsible for this. The state and neglect of the building they own is enough to warrant their own review.\n\r\nThere simply isn\\'t enough time or space to go into detail of everything Reign did. But I\\'ll start with the flat. Converted from an old uni building and cheaply bought up. It shows. Who puts a toilet right next to the outside wall of a corridor? The bathroom sink and shower are incredibly claustrophobic and nearing inaccessible levels and would be absolutely impossible to access if you are a bigger person.\r\nEverytime I would wash my face\/take a shower water would splash everywhere due to the miniture size. \n\r\nI am disabled, and due to their incredibly invasive background checks they are aware of that. So at first I assumed that their treatment of me was due to ableism. But it seems that it\\'s a universal thing as so many others have been through the same.\r\nSpeaking to other tenants and reading the other reviews enlightened me that I was not the only one experiencing this madness. The amount of 1 star reviews should be a red flag to any prospective renter.\r\nI have to agree with others on Sapna. Her attitude is deeply patronising, bullying and unprofessional. She appears to be receiving a lot of complaints.\n\n\r\nEvery single request was either ignored, stalled or outright denied.\r\nReign were especially very begrudging about supplying meter readings. I would need a reading every few months at the request of my electric company to keep my bills right and I dreaded every time I would ask for one. Of course, most of the time this was ignored but occasionally if I did receive one I was told that I was asking too often and they would drive the point of \\\"nobody else asks this much.\\\"\r\nFirstly, I\\'m sure that\\'s not true and is just a singling-out tactic. I don\\'t care how often others need a reading. I\\'m paying my bills, I have a right to know how much I personally owe.\r\nSecondly, A tenant has legal access to their meter. (they are locked behind a door.) And if you are prepared to charge the extortionate amount of rent of \u00a3575 for a human-sized goldfish bowl, you better be prepared to take two seconds to send a photo of my meter.\r\nYou get someone in to test the fire alarm every Friday, there is no excuse.\n\r\nThere were ample problems in the flat and building. Far too many to list here but some were:\r\nSinks that were constantly blocked no matter how many times I unblocked it, all lights in the building corridors going off so it was pitch black and nothing done about it, spider infestation in the building, smashed glass on the window upon moving in, windows permanently jammed so I could not move them to open\/close, appliances that broke within 2 years including radiator\/washer (electrician and repair people confirmed the shoddy workmanship.) \r\nBroken trip breaker in lift in building making loud noises constantly that can be heard from flat, (took over a year of correspondence to them and eventual escalation to council before it was fixed. And the noise came back a few months later. This goes without saying is VERY dangerous.), door came off washing machine that was ignored when brought to their attention, I had to message them over and over again until something was done. \r\nOf course, I always lived in fear of complaining too much and being evicted so I\\'d often overlook many things.\r\nTo add more to the washer situation, it took them FOURTY DAYS of complaining to finally get their finger out and do something. \r\nLandlord came and I was baffled at how completely clueless she was. She brought no tape measure to measure the dimensions of the washer so relied on her phone charger and a marker of mine instead. She also had no idea how to dispose of an old washer in the UK. Can I remind everyone these are our landlords, the guys who are supposed to know these things.\r\nGood thing to know my rent went on her \u00a32000 plus Louis Vuitton bag she brought in my flat, rather than her investing in a tape measure.\r\nMultiple types of alarms going off constantly in the building, fire alarm sounding constantly, my entire flat would SHAKE every time someone outside closed a door, I\\'m guessing it\\'s due to there being no insulation and the paper thin walls.\r\nTenants upstairs would also make banging, crashing, thumping, dragging heavy objects upstairs, slamming doors. Hammering. All through the night. The walls are so thin I could hear someone sneezing\/coughing from down the hall constantly. And all noises from neighbours. There is no privacy.\r\nTheir contracted repairman came to my flat many times due to it being supplied with dreadful cheap and shoddy fixtures. He had no respect and would literally grab and throw my belongings around.\r\nHe even said when my washer was broken for over 40 days and dirty clothes piles were everywhere. \\\"Sorry I can\\'t fix your washer next week, I\\'m going to Ibiza!\\\" Then why didn\\'t they bother to send anyone else?\n\n\r\nAnother huge red flag would be many people moved out of our building. The turnover rate was staggering. I\\'ve only been here two years but it seemed that every day almost there would be new tenants. When speaking to some of these tenants they mentioned Reign also ignored similar issues mentioned. So I was definitely not alone in this.\r\nAs well as my flat, there was constant problems with the building. Including sewage leakage that happened multiple times. It was absolutely vile. I cannot stress enough how the entire building was a place of squalor that was falling apart, without a doubt a modern day slum. Did I mention package thieves were abundant there? And how incredibly loud it was constantly? \n\r\nAll my correspondence to Reign was ignored via email and the phone was never picked up until the issue reached urgent levels and I was treated like a nuisance for bringing repairs to their attention. Many of which were already issues before I moved in.\r\nIf you don\\'t like tenants complaining about issues then don\\'t supply shoddily made properties that are falling apart. \r\nWhen I first moved in I had the electricians sort out my oven and they certainly had some strong words for them on how cheap they are - words I can\\'t publish here. \r\nOf course my correspondence was ignored but when it was time to renew the year long tenancy, then they decided to repeatedly hound me about that. \n\r\nThere is a complete lack of empathy in regards to situations beyond your control. \r\nOne of the worst things they did was when I repeatedly brought the mould situation to their attention and they finally decided to budge only when the whole bathroom ceiling was caked in black mould. They sent around a contractor when I had lost a loved one and was grieving. I apologised but informed them that I would have to rearrange. There was no sympathy or humanity given and they demanded to have the contractor immediately return despite the fact they knew I was grieving. This was for a mould issue that was there before I moved in and they should have cleaned up beforehand. Now because the mould grew to dangerous levels - that could have been prevented if they were competent enough to clean it before I moved in - they were scrambling to get rid of it. \r\nIf someone had died close to you and you couldn\\'t come to repair my flat I\\'d totally understand. So show some basic human decency and at the very least offer your condolences.\n\r\nDue to so many of these issues being ignored by them I had to take matters to the council which caused a lot of stress. The fire department also got involved due to alarms going off in the building, of course when I brought this to Reign\\'s attention it was ignored.\r\nThe fire alarm would sound multiple times a day and all through the night with nobody turning it off. At that point I didn\\'t know an emergency number for the building existed as Reign lied to me and said there wasn\\'t one. \r\nSo the fire brigade would arrive over and over again in multiple fire engines, wasting precious time that could be spent saving lives. \r\nWe would usually get THREE fire engines come here, wasting resources. Non-stop over and over again to the point where most of the tenants would ignore the fire alarm because they would know it wasn\\'t a real emergency. Which is a huge health and safety issue!\r\nAll because the management couldn\\'t be bothered to sort out the fire alarm issue.\n\n\r\nNot to mention, we were forced to stay outside for hours in the dark night until the alarm was turned off, this wasn\\'t just a one or two time thing. It happened many, many times. Due to the neglect of addressing whoever would constantly set the alarm off.\r\nOnce I informed them I was to move out I was once again - you guessed it - ignored.\r\nThe final thing that prompted me to leave this dump was despite all the neglect they still decided to hike up the rent by a few hundred a year. THAT I DID NOT AGREE TO BUT THEY CHARGED ANYWAY. That was the final straw.\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the moving out process was also abhorrent. They tried to get viewings booked while I was still living there, they were that desperate for more money.\r\nI did not get back my deposit either, which I suspected. Despite fighting to try and get it back they refused. I could not clean the flat fully due to needing to leave in a hurry, but was happy to pay for anything that needed doing, as long as I could receive proof of cost.\r\nI didn\\'t get any proof whatsoever and they stalled the process so I was forced to pay 2 months worth of rent for a flat I\\'m not even living in anymore. And they still have the gall to ask me for even more as of writing.\r\nI was reprimanded for not being able to clean the flat to their standard that I CANNOT do anyhow due to my disability, of which reason is NONE of their business, but once again I was still happy to pay for it done from my deposit. \r\nThey actually asked for the money upfront until I argued with them tirelessly that it should come out of my deposit. So yes, I almost handed over yet another \u00a3575 to them. They really do clutch at straws.\r\nThey framed it in a way that I refused to pay and couldn\\'t be bothered to clean, yet another hurtful lie to add to their countless others.\r\nI was even forced to pay for things that I didn\\'t do. The \\\"excessive marks\\\" on the wall I was forced to pay for were already there all over the walls when I moved in and the condensation was due to being supplied BROKEN old windows of terrible quality that WILL NOT OPEN OR CLOSE AND ARE JAMMED.\r\nDo you honestly expect people who have moved overseas to come back to clean their slum of a flat? You never bothered to help with anything but expect me to clean up the dump?\r\nI can\\'t stress enough how much this company are greedy thieves.\r\nThey took almost all of my deposit and I know for a fact it doesn\\'t cost \u00a3575 (which is \\\"coincidentally\\\" a month of rent.) to clean and make minor repairs to a tiny studio flat.\r\nAgain, they refused to provide any proof of cost.\r\nOh sorry, I guess they do need more of my money to buy a new Louis Vuitton bag...\r\nI worked it out and have paid EXACTLY \u00a315,500 to them and it\\'s abhorrent that they have took so much of my money and have barely lifted a finger.\r\nI have been forced to move back in with my parents due to being unable to afford their ridiculous costs. I am absolutely devastated and these leeches STILL want more of my money after I\\'ve left. They also said they never got the keys back in a desperate ploy for more money, luckily I was having none of the nonsense and kept the receipt for a royal mail signed delivery. Always keep your documentation! I will not be handing any more fees, because they are happy to lie over and over again to suck you dry of as much money as possible.\r\nIf this isn\\'t bad enough, my flat is currently listed online for \u00a3750. \r\n I feel sorry for whoever takes that flat now! You\\'re paying \u00a3200 more than it originally was!\r\nBefore there was an end to this madness, I mostly coped alone but it got so bad I had to ask for help from my mum and an external organisation because I was in tears multiple times with it all. According to my mum, Sapna implied I broke the stuff MYSELF in my flat rather than it breaking naturally due to it being CHEAP AND BAD QUALITY.\r\nI was and still am afraid of them but I won\\'t let them silence us any longer.\r\nIf it wasn\\'t for me seeking help from a professional to negotiate with them they would have still been charging me more rent even though I don\\'t live there anymore. I\\'m baffled by how it\\'s legal to force tenants to pay for a place they DO NOT LIVE AT until they find a new one.\n\r\nDue to my personal circumstances, I literally could not leave. I had no money for any better. I was trapped in this nightmare for two years and scared to post this review until now as the fear of eviction was very real and being thrown out on to the streets should I speak up.\r\nIt was an extremely traumatic experience and has seriously affected my mental and physical health. \n\r\nI only hope that karma does what\\'s due and Reign\/Sapna\/Pinky\/B-Hive\/Bowen Zhang\/APW and everyone else get investigated, because someone needs to speak up about this, and this goes for all those who have had dealings with these crooks, past and present.\r\nThey need to be formally investigated, because the maltreatment and advantage taken of tenants needs to end.\r\nI wasn\\'t sure to share this, but this experience with living in such horrible conditions was so horrific it did cause suicidal ideation in me. I never felt safe. It was a horribly unsecure, polluted, dirty, unsafe area and I recieved sexual harassment from another tenant which I had to contact the police for. \n\r\nDecent housing is a human right. People are being forced to live in these conditions due to any decent living being completely unaffordable these days. I saw many young children and babies living in these flats and it was deeply upsetting to see.\r\nNobody deserves to live their lives out in misery or disrepair and I wasted two years of mine at the hands of Reign.\r\nThere\\'s nothing more to say other than this agency is a perfect example of a modern day slumlord cutting corners and taking advantage of the cost of living crisis driven by greed and profit. Where you are dehumanised are treated like a cashcow.\r\nAvoid at all costs if you value your health and sanity. \r\nBBC Radio One Newsbeat was just the start...","1723":null,"1724":"Finally e moved out of this property, all was a nightmare from start to finish","1725":"Absolutely the worst landlord I have ever met in my entire life.

Room was fairly tidy upon move in, however live in landlord situation was not ideal. Communal kitchen area was not always clean, dishes could be left for days before being moved to dishwasher which made it difficult to then clean own crockery. Small cupboard space allocated for dry foods, not very ideal for long term letting as you feel more like a guest rather than someone renting a room. \n\r\nWardrobe handle was missing when moved in and not replaced. However, when second handle came loose (cheap material) a deduction was made from the deposit to fix this despite the other handle not being fixed when I moved in. Landlords used deposit money to purchase two handles which would no doubt fix both missing handles even though only one handle was damaged during tenancy. This would come under usual wear and tear and most circumstances would not have led to a deposit reduction, especially considering there was already a handle missing.\n\r\nLandlords could also be quite noisy with arguments and late night disturbances which isn\\'t ideal if you have work the next morning.","1727":"I had a very comfortable stay during my two-year tenancy in this property, which I found to be very clean and modern.

The kitchen was cleaned by an external cleaner every two weeks, although I found that the housemates (young professionals) were respectful and also helped to keep it clean in the meantime. As a landlord, Martin is very professional and approachable. He was always quick to respond to any queries and sort out any issues in the house.","1728":"The flat is mouldy\/damp. Don\\'t be fooled as they paint the mould white when you move out so the next tenant will not see it, but it will start to show in the fall. The heating does not work, the electric is faulty.

It cost almost \u00a3100 a week  to barely heat the place in December month using electric heaters as the one storage heater in the flat doesn\\'t heat the room, and what heat you do get from the costly electric heaters only gets sucked out the windows as they are not sealed properly.

There were giant cracks all over the walls, places where the magnolia paint had been touched up in white, scuffs on the floors and mouldy windowsills. The kitchen was the worst - one cupboard door had already broken and had been fixed by attaching a block of wood to the inside of the cupboard and a hook to the inside of the door - you literally had to close the cupboard by hanging the door onto the block. Another cupboard hinge snapped during our tenancy and the landlord tried to make us pay \u00a3200; despite the repair man saying the unit was so old that replacement parts were no longer available (and despite only the hinge being broken) he insisted that it was in perfect condition and we had broken it through \\\"negligence\\\".\n\r\nHe gave us barely any induction at all, leaving us to figure out how everything worked on our own. This included eventually realising after a week of trying to set the timer that the \\\"central heating\\\" he had advertised (and still advertises!) was non-existent and what we had was storage heaters. Half of which never worked and were never fixed because when we reported them as broken, the landlord just replied \\\"no they are not\\\". When our washing machine broke, he made us wait over a week then installed the new one himself. The first time we used it, the pipe gushed water like a tap and when the plumber came to fix it he said \\\"whoever put this in had no idea what they were doing\\\". \n\r\nThroughout our tenancy the landlord was rude, condescending and unhelpful. Half way through our first year, the letting agent showed up at the door without any warning and said he was showing people round for next year - to which we replied \\\"but we\\'re not even moving!\\\" He then informed us that if we wanted to stay, the rent would be rising by \u00a345 a month. When we moved out he attempted to deduct money from our deposit for all kinds of things, from additional cleaning after we had it done professionally, to removing items we had \\\"left behind\\\" but that had in fact been there when we moved in, to an \\\"admin fee\\\" for him to personally walk around the flat after we had left it.

Poor insulation and very thin walls means you can hear *everything* your neighbours are doing (yes everything). House was extremely dirty when we moved in and full of holes which meant it was hard to keep warm in the winter and the EPC rating is very low too - this also resulted in a mould problem. Had to ask for a water pump to be fitted as shower came out as a drip too. These houses are very narrow so not really suitable for modern TVs\/furniture, and small windows mean not much natural light. Wouldn\u2019t recommend the houses on this street at all - very old and not suitable for modern living, even when renovated.","1768":"A horrible property -- overpriced and \\\"renovated\\\" poorly. The agent in charge of managing the property was rude, unprofessional, and unhelpful. She arrived late to almost every appointment with little or no prior notice, even though we were constantly under threat of being fined if we were late. She did not seem to want to help us solve issues. \n\r\nFrom the beginning, we had a boiler that leaked carbon monoxide. There was a detector that did not work so it took days and flatmates becoming unwell for us to realise the issue. It was fixed but not well and became an issue again. Eventually it was fixed but a terrible start to the tenancy.  \n\r\nFurthermore, the bathroom had been renovated before we moved in but it was done very poorly. For example, there was some sort of foil around wooden handles on a cabinet to make them look like they were made of stainless steel. However, as the bathroom barely had any ventilation, the foil peeled off quickly and we will be fined for damage, even though it is a design issue in the renovation. Also, there was some sort of screen put over the walls to make the bathroom look nicer and more modern. This covered the original walls and consequently, covered a window that could have been used for ventilation. This would have been helpful in preventing a buildup of steam when showering because throughout the lease, we just had to have the fan (and thus the light, increasing our electricity bill significantly) on in the bathroom at all times. Additionally, we rarely had hot water in the shower and when we tried to get it fixed we were simply told there was a water pressure issue and that we should run the cold tap in the sink to get hot water in the shower, which resulted in lukewarm water in the shower. \n\r\nAs previously stated, there was a renovation carried out before we moved into the flat. This resulted in the flat being converted from a 3 bedroom to a 4 bedroom. Thus, the kitchen was directly in the middle of the flat with no windows. The renovation also resulted in the boiler being in a cupboard in a bedroom. This made the carbon monoxide leak even worse. Since this bedroom was part of the kitchen before the renovation, it had a small window with very little natural light, making the room  dark and gloomy to live in. The renovation also resulted in the flat being carpeted. Before the renovation, the flat had hardwood floors, and we requested to keep those. However, even though we had been given the option, we were told it was not possible and that it was going to be carpeted. This made the flat very difficult to keep clean as the carpet collected lots of dust. It would have been easier to clean if we had been provided with a proper hoover, but we were not and hoovering was a difficult task.\n\r\nAt the time of the checkout we had ridiculous fines against us for things like not hoovering (which we did, the hoover the letting agency provided us was just useless) and normal wear and tear of the paint in the kitchen. Again, it was not well ventilated so any steam from cooking damaged\/stained the poor paint job. This was not due to negligence or lack of care, but once again, poor design in the renovation. \n\r\nOverall, I do not recommend the property or the letting agency (Prestige Properties).","1769":"Tenants should be very careful when considering this property. Either avoid or get your own professional check in report done to a high standard.\n\r\nThe quality of the check out report vs the check in report was used to highlight long time existing problems with the property which when compared were used to exploit our tenant deposit.\n\r\nThoroughly polite but ultimately incompetent landlord bordering on morally dubious. Clearly used to catching tenants off guard at the end of tenancy and recouping unnecessary deductions for property improvements and building works due to sustained landlord negligence.\n\r\nOverall property in need of serious work constantly leaking bathroom, hollow walls floor and windows that do not open. Very old house several sightings of mice and very poorly maintained in doors, floors lights and plumbing - need to lots work. Reasonable tenants very likely to get stung for most or, all of deposit upon departure if not careful.","1770":"We have been deeply unsatisfied with this property. A failure in the roof causing rain to get funnelled into the cavity wall and the completely broken gutters took almost an entire year to get any response to despite constant chasing. Meanwhile we were forced to endure a massive build up of damp causing mould up the walls, slug infestations, peeling walls, foul odours and extremely dangerous electrics (rain would result in the fuses tripping). The heating system is shockingly inefficient and the timer does not work meaning during winter when the hot water tank goes cold\/tepid (legionella risk) you can\\'t have hot water when you get home from work and typically end up boiling a kettle to do the washing up. The immersion heater has a fault and will trip out the electrics almost the moment it is switched on. Our complaints that the cooker hob was dangerous as you could not sustain a reliable flame on all hobs was ignored entirely and never resolved. The equipment provided to maintain the garden was entirely unsafe. The back gate cannot be closed meaning the local kids use the garden as a shortcut between Wilbraham Road and Sopwith Road. Neighbour has been demanding the property fences are replaced for years but they continue to rot. Back door canopy is badly rotting and shedding planks (mind they don\\'t fall on you). Despite constant chasing it took us 9 months to get our copy of the lease from the agents and we are still waiting to see the gas safety certificate for this year. Agent and landlord typically did not respond at all when concerns were raised and when they did it was only to send us a letter that our requested repairs would not be fixed. The neighbour has also reported a rat infestation, but to be fair we never saw any (perhaps the legions of slugs in the kitchen and living room scared them away).","1771":null,"1772":"Apartment is very well insulated and gets a lot of light.

At the beginning of the tenancy the landlord was reasonable and approachable. However, one of the other tenants suffered from mental health issues which resulting in them taking a dislike to me. The tenant wanted to the house to be silent after 10pm, and even having a phone conversation in my room or watching TV at a low volume caused an issue for them. The tenant also woke up at 6am on a daily basis and would then play music with their door open for the following two hours, waking me up. However I accepted that as it was a house share there needed to be give and take and just ignored the noise. The tenants mental health issues continued and they began continually reporting me to the landlord for noise issues, when I was not noisy. They told the landlord that they would leave if I wasn\\'t evicted. This resulted in the landlord evicting me, and taking the other tenants side, the landlord did not listen to my side of the story. They then claimed I had left the room dirty and blamed me for staining on the mattress which was there when I moved in (I had a mattress protector on the mattress for the entire tenancy). The deposit was protected with an insurance scheme so I couldn\\'t dispute it as the landlord had it and would not believe that I hadn\\'t stained the mattress. I was also charged cleaning fees for a professional clean when the room was not professionally cleaned when I moved in.","1775":null,"1776":"Landlord (Mark Hobson) failed to resolve maintenence issues despite numerous emails and reports.

Been living few months without hot water and heating, broken windows and furniture that the landlord does not want to throw away (never ask for a replacement) so finally decided to move out.\n\r\nIt is a pity that such a nice flat is not having any kind of maintenance aside of painting the walls to trick the next tenant to rent it. The property is currently in breach of the current regulation which the agent and landlord does not seem to care.\n\r\nThe property agent ( bspoke properties ) blames the landlord but I have no means to contact the landlord as they are acting as the landlord on my contract.\n\r\nLong story short, nothing gets sorted and your only option is move out.\n\r\nDuring the move out I left the property cleaner than during the move in, where the property was not cleaned and had food and intimate stuff from the previous tenant which I cleaned\/disposed. The agency is claiming \u00a3100 for cleaning as I have not completely removed all dust from under the bed and cleaning has to be arranged. Never given the opportunity to do the 2min hoovering myself as requested.","1782":"A lovely flat to rent with a couple of friends. Is just a short walking distance from the University of Aberdeen and not too far from the beach or Don river, so highly suitable for students.

Landlord claimed that a cleaner comes twice a week not true. The fridge was a struggle to share with 5 people, no cupboard to store food.\r\nAbove all the landlord told me to leave a day after I paid him when I left he did not return my deposit he claimed that his account is frozen, yet other still paying him rent.

Still in the process of trying to get any of my deposit back and I know they have retained deposits of others in the building that have left. The stress and cost of heating bills and cost of buying heaters as there are only two old heaters in the living room was not worth the cheaper rent.","1792":"I lived here with my partner at the time and we were very good tenants. We had very few issues during our tenancy and when we did they were minor. Rent was always paid on time and we took good care of the flat while we lived there. So you can imagine our surprise when the landlords (who were extremely nice in person) took \u00a3300 out of our deposit! I was given this list of reasons:\n\r\n1) The shower curtain has been replaced as this was marked with mould and was in good condition at the start of the tenancy.\n\r\n2) The hallway requires re-decorating. Although small marks were noted on the inventory at the start of the tenancy substantial marks are now present, please see photos attached. There is also an area of wall that is damaged to one of the walls in the living room. The cost to re-paint both the hallway and front room is \u00a3160.\n\r\n3) The mattress requires replacing. The landlord purchased the furniture from Ikea so a new mattress has to be purchased from Ikea so that the sizes match, Ikea do not have standard sizes. The cost of this \u00a3134.\n\r\nI can assure you that despite a shower curtain being mouldy (mould is extremely hard to avoid in new builds and has been an issue in every one I\\'ve lived in), every issue was general wear and tear which is accepted within a tenancy. \n\r\nAvoid this flat as your deposit will go towards the owners making improvements to the flat which they should be paying for themselves. The letting agency were very unhelpful and did nothing to help us fight this.","1793":"Although high rise flats are looked down upon, they are more secure than many houses and bungalows. Most have cctv in the bigger towns like Birmingham and solihull.\r\nRegular problems are water leaks from above flats and the smell of cannabis is becoming an issue more and more for decent tenants.\r\nNoise from adjoining flats can be an issue.\r\nThe only high rise blocks in solihull are in the North and have benefited from double glazing.\r\nNew heating systems are more expensive to run than the old economy 7 systems still in some blocks.\n\r\nAll these comment are from my experience as a tenant in solihull and birmingham over the last 28 years.","1794":"I had a really nice stay in this flat during my undergardaute years at University of Aberdeen. The flat is only 8 minutes with bicycle to Uni and 15 to town (and also 15 to the beach, which might be of interest of keen surfers;)). The living room is spacious and great for dinners with flatmates and occasional yoga sessiosn as well! The three bedrooms are facing southwards, so it\\'s quite sunny in the rooms even in the short winter days, which is great! The neighbours were really nice too!

They were reported several times and were never fully resolved. The flat is a basement flat and I suffered from congestion and irritated eyes from the damp. Our clothes always smelt musty. We had to keep cleaning off the mould and the landlord kept making up excuses as to why the work had not been done. When we moved in The garden was in a terrible state, piles of rubbish and even asbestos sheeting that took weeks and weeks to get removed. The landlord offered no help to get the garden back into a usable state. When we moved in the oven and boiler was not working. The boiler is very old and not economical at all. The carpets and flooring are thin and have no underlay. The house above is a student house and you can hear everything through the ceiling no sound proofing at all. The landlord always took weeks to get things fixed and did not spend any money on the property.","1796":"The landlord was introduced by one of the biggest Estate Agents in the UK, we found out he has a share in the Estate Agent. They pushed us to rent the said property telling us all will be amazing. The property looked renovated properly at first however  in the past year, many things broke in the flat due to the cheapness of it. We had damp wall, unsafe plugs, leaks and excessive noise from neighbors as the property isn\u2019t properly insulated. We can hear absolutely everything and 12 flats are cramped in a converted house. He has not installed fire prevention items for a whole year and quickly did it at last minute to avoid fine. The landlord does not answer queries, he ignores us, ignores requests for repairs or refuses to discuss essential issues in regards to the tenancy. He is not responsive and left us in limbo. He has not dealt with anything and we had to move as soon as we coule due to the fact he is unresponsive. I do not recommend the place if you want a landlord that is managing their property at the standard required by law and expected by tenants.","1797":null,"1798":null,"1799":"Apartment is of studio type.\r\nMultiple such apartments in same building.\r\nBut residents are good and respect each others privacy.\r\nApartment not big( since studio)..but has all facilities- washer\/dryer, refrigerator( small) which fits below slab, oven, microwave etc.\r\nBoiler for hot water & heating but it is present directly inside house which looks awkward sometimes\r\n One heating panel.

Rubbish collection and disposal is also a major problem as neighbours are not the most considerate, entrance will be full of litter and requires frequent cleaning. Landlord was contactable most of the time and quite helpful when it comes to basic things but did not ensure house was properly cleaned when we move in. We left the house in a similar state of cleanliness however, landlord wanted us to pay the bill of more than \u00a3300 for professional cleaning. Agent (Cedar Estates) was helpful at the start of tenancy rental but was less enthusiastic nearing the end of our tenancy, deposit return was delayed and in my opinion, quite poorly done.","1811":"Dibbens who manage the property have been fantastic (particularly Laura) but landlady (who also works for Dibbens) will try and take as much deposit as possible.

The area is fairly secure, we didn\\'t have any issues with anyone although you may see some dodgy people in the area from time to time.

We also pointed out a couple of things that were broken or not in a good state and they were not included in the inventory, but the estate agency just decided to ignore it.\n\r\nAfter a couple of nights, we realised the mattress was horrendous, it was very old and you could feel the springs in your back all the time. After several weeks of back and forths with the agency, they told us that the landlord was not keen to replace it and if we wanted a better one we could have one. However, they were not removing the old one and the flat is not exactly the most spacious one to store an extra mattress in there. So, after a month or so with continued discussion, the landlord accepted to buy one which was worth \u00a3100... Of course, this was the same quality as the old one! That\\'s when we realised there was no point to continue arguing about it because the landlord wouldn\\'t do anything else for us.\n\r\nLater in our tenancy, the washing machine broke and it took them about a month to get it replaced, of course, no compensation was given to us for going to the laundry during that time...\r\nThe same happened to the dishwasher, it took several weeks to get it replaced. Luckily, we didn\\'t use it that often...\n\r\nAt the end of our tenancy, we knew that the landlord was a penny-pincher and he would try to keep our deposit, so we recorded in a video every single area of the flat so we had evidence of the state of it in case of any complaints. The landlord wanted to charge us around \u00a3300 for things that were not caused by us, and even more, these were things that we pointed out to LifeResidential when we started our tenancy. \r\nSince LifeResidential never supports us during this process, we opened a dispute with MyDeposits, submitted all our evidence, and let them decide what was fair. In the end, the resolution was in our favor and we got most of our deposit back.\n\r\nEven when this is a lovely flat, I would recommend staying away from this landlord and if you have an option, don\\'t choose LifeResidential as your estate agency, it\\'s not worth the hassle!!","1822":"The only problem with this property was public transportation as the busses didn\\'t always arrive on time and were not very frequent.

We emailed CONSTANTLY and it took 6 MONTHS for the landlord to secure our property, and he only bothered doing his job because we got environmental health involved who eventually threatened him with legal action. He uses the estate agents to manage his property so you cannot even contact him directly and estate agents are somehow not allowed to arrange any repairs to make your house safe without the landlords consent so all they can do is email him and wait for a reply.

There was a water leak from a defective drainpipe that we reported which likely contributed to the damp , but there are possibly issues with the building as well ( type of building, old windows) that make it prone to damp.  The landlady was quite responsive and did allow us to end the tenancy early.  However we had asked about damp before moving in and this was minimised and put down to previous tenants being anxious.  This was slightly how landlady responded to me.\r\nThe water leak is likely to take at least a summer to fully dry out so it\u2019s worth being cautious about letting this property unless there\u2019s reassurance that dehumidification of the area of the leak has happened, and that all mould has been removed before moving in.","1882":"Problem landlord would not fix anything!!

Both the agent and landlord were very aware of this prior to allowing us move in with three children under the age of six. We had the first five months with them running through the kitchen. Our concerns were initially ignored. The agents and landlord acted after the dishwasher had its water and electrical supply chewed simultaneously leaving an electrified pool on the kitchen floor. The holes in the kitchen floor have been subsequently blocked. This has to date prevented any rats entering the kitchen. They can be readily heard scratching under the floors and in the walls of the ground floor. The rat-man explained there is a drain issue that can not be resolved, meaning this issue will not go away!\r\nThere is a significant damp issue in the kitchen area. The attempted remedy was to paint inside the cupboards with damp resistant paint. This action failed. The lower cupboards in half the kitchen are usable unless you are prepared to remove items regularly to wash the mould off.\r\nThe kitchen and bathrooms are very tired although functioning. The toilet has a poorly designed u bend that continually blocks. Despite this being a design issue the agent will not repair it without charging the Tennant. \r\nThe upstairs bedroom has squirrels living in the roof space.

We noticed there had been an issue in the lounge with mould as the wallpaper was very badly stained but we assumed that cause of damp had been fixed.  Also the wallpaper in the kitchen was black in places  but stains looked old so again assumed problem had been dealt with but property had not been redecorated.  \r\nWe took the property because of its size and were very limited with choice at the time.  The night we moved in, we had an issue with the heating and there was a power cut so we ended up sleeping on the floor, didnt realise until many months later into the tenancy that the lounge floor was concrete and there was massive cracks in it which had caused damp issues in lounge.  Our energy bill went up because it was a cold house (the patio doors, window frames and also back door were very dated, aluminium and not fit for purpose).  This was another cause of the excessive damp and condensation problem we experienced.  We met with the landlord and he seemed nice enough but our opinion of him changed over the course of the tenancy.  He lived around the corner so would quite often turn up unannounced and had no concept of  \\\"Quiet Enjoyment\\\". On one occasion one of the glass lamp covers in the front room fell off, it was that old.  Luckily it did not happen when anyone was around.  Unfortunately this made the light pendant dangerous because part of the electrics of the light was now exposed and when it was switched on it had live electricity flowing through it. We asked that something be done about it.  The landlord was adamant, he wanted the light to stay as it was, because the light was old it could not be replaced but the landlord was fond of it, he had previously lived in the house and was obviously attached to it and did not want his house changing.  Eventually common sense prevailed and a new pendant was fitted but we felt it should have been dealt with immediately because of the safety issue.    Winter of 2015 was really bad.  Freezing cold house when heating switched off, damp everywhere.  It became obvious house had been rented out to us with nothing been done about the damp.  We also noticed there was structural damage to the brickwork outside of the house which would have contributed to the damp.  We ended up moving out because situation was intolerable,  I remember on one occasion I was cooking a pan of pasta and didnt notice the large slug that was clinging to the side of the pan.  We had a lot of slugs because of damp.  When we moved out, landlord tried to take all of our deposit and the letting agents Quick and Clarke did not really help.  Landlord accused us of ruining work surfaces (which was obviously not true) We needed to get our deposit back so we agreed to let him have \u00a3120 to pay for new work surfaces.  Have noticed property is now up for rent.  Work surfaces are still the same so he just pocketed \u00a3120 of our money  Have noticed lounge has been painted over, one of the bedrooms has been re-wallpapered but I would urge anyone looking to rent this property to check for signs that the damp has been dealt with and if unsure ASK, the house is one of the worst we have ever rented.  Landlord also said a funny thing, said we were nice tenants and he didnt really want to take our deposit, so why did he take a big chunk of it.","1904":"Landlord did not put my deposit in protection scheme. Landlord broke the \\\\\\\"right to privacy\\\\\\\" rule within the Housing Act, and within my 6 months living here let herself in to the shared flat most weeks to sit in the kitchen doing her business, disturbing me in the shower one time, having her friend over till 11pm one night whilst she was setting up a fellow tenants\\\\\\' furniture which she had not sorted out before he had moved in!\r\nShe also dealt with a charlatan agency who let himself into the flat and harassed me trying to get us to sign a new contract increasing the rent by \u00a3300! Upon several requests for him to leave my home, he only left when I had to call the police and the landlord!","1905":"The property inside was fair--nice light in living room in the day, some cute details like towel ladder in bathroom and fancy knobs on some of the doors, nice bedroom size.  The outside of the property was ugly and there was often trash everywhere.  Very loud neighbours in the back--mostly domestic violence issues which were addressed numerous times with police.  (Downstairs neighbour respectful about turning music down, keeping front area as clean as possible.)  I am mostly writing this because of the landlords.  The husband, very nice, fixed the numerous broken things in a timely manner, but the wife has been rude and extraordinarily unreasonable about level of cleanliness during tenancy as well as the end of tenancy checkout.  She required inspections randomly and chastised us as if we were children about normal wear and tear--which we found patronising and unprofessional.  We were excellent tenants (and I, myself, want things very clean and tidy all the time).  She required an end-of-tenancy professional cleaning, and was not satisfied after we paid almost \u00a3300.  She took about \u00a3300 from our deposit money to do a \\\"top up\\\" clean.  She would not negotiate with us, and became ruder and ruder.  Although it may sound petty, her husband once said (in a light, joking manner) that his wife \\\"has fired every single cleaning company we\\'ve ever had,\\\" and that, to me, was a warning sign that I didn\\'t take seriously enough.  So, in summary: the property was a two out five considering the dingy environment and terrible back neighbours--and although Matt was nice, his wife made the experience of living there miserable.  We felt that we always had eyes watching us, and that nothing was good enough in terms of cleanliness and normal wear and tear.  Let alone her condescending rudeness.","1906":"Firstly, i do not rent from flat 1, for anonymity sake while I still have to rent here until the end of the contract I put flat 1.

Cleaned the floor carpet every 6 months with a rented carpet cleaning machine, kept the courtyard in an organised condition, painted all the rooms, the bathroom and the kitchen to make ourselves more comfortable. However every time something had to be changed in the property like washing machine or fridge the landlord raised the rental price. \r\nSince the end of February our combi boiler has stopped working and the landlord only gave us promises to fix it. Claims it is our fault that is not working and should be our cost to change it,too. Clearly this boiler has not been serviced and checked in the past 5 years at least. This is the 3rd week we are left without heating although we do have some warm water occasionally. I had to go to the swimming pool for a week to have at least a proper hot shower once at the end of day.\r\nThere is promise that the boiler will be changed this week however we all hope this is really going to happen. 3 different repair guys were sent here but they were not willing to touch it just advised it has to be changed to a new one immediately. If it won`t happen and the cost will forced upon us I believe this is the time to take legal action.\r\nThe landlord also said if we do not like the state of the house we can move out. We all have these conversations in writing. \r\nAlthough none of us wants to move and the house is always clean and tidy we would love to stay here as long as we can but without heating and warm water I believe this won`t really happen. \r\nWe always paid the rent on time and had not ask a single penny for the painting and entire cleaning but I believe the situation we are left in, is really one-sided.\r\nBesides there is some violent crime once\/twice a year in the street.

Avoid the property at any cost unless the landlord has changed agent.","1927":null,"1928":"Although the property was pleasant, I noticed that after I\\'d been there a couple of years the landlord\\'s attitude towards me changed. I don\\'t know why this was although the elderly woman who lived in the property directly beneath was not only a friend of his wife\\'s but was a bit too much of a gossip and always wanted to draw me into nasty conversations about him and his wife. I used to ignore her as I was uncomfortable about this but she was very persistent.\r\nAfter five years I began to notice that my gas boiler was never checked every year and that the gaps between one boiler service and the next were widening. The landlord started either ignoring things I requested; for example, there was an old - fashioned pantry with a tiny window that was jammed open. I asked that this please be fixed so that I could shut it but it was never done, so the flat was colder than it should have been, resulting in higher bills. I actually started my tenancy in June 2007 and by 2012 mould began appearing on the outside walls of one of the bedrooms and in the hallway, again on the outside wall, despite never drying clothes in rooms with closed windows. When I mentioned this to the landlord all he said was \\\"this flat has always been damp\\\". No measures were taken to fix it so I ended up cleaning the mould off regularly myself. Once I rang him up at home and got his wife instead who was rude and antagonistic for no reason. He himself started complaining about the cost of everything, how poor he was and couldn\\'t afford things, etc but I noticed that he bought himself a brand new car, had a boat, had a new roof on his own house and the cottage next door to his which he also owned and managed to afford a three-week cruise last year.\r\nThere were originally four Scotch pines at the end of the garden which hung over the washing line and were quite large. I asked if they could be trimmed back but he refused saying that they were a protected species (they aren\\'t). When I told him this he said he wasn\\'t going to cut them back because his wife liked trees! Yet when the new neighbours moved into a house which backed onto the rear garden on my flat and therefore realised that these trees were a problem, asked to cut the branches down, the landlord\\'s wife gave permisdion so the argument didn\\'t stand up.\r\nThe last straw was in October 2013 when I collapsed in my hallway. In order to get the paramedics to gain access to the flat it needed to be unlocked which I was unable to do so I ended up in a roundabout way getting in touch with the landlord\\'s wife. She came around, along with her friend downstairs, who always claimed that she couldn\\'t climb stairs yet managed it on that occasion, and they not only allowed the paramedics in but went through some paperwork I was sorting out without my permission (I discovered it had been disturbed when I was discharged from hospital a week later). I also discovered that the landlord\\'s wife had given a spare key to my flat to the downstairs neighbour which I apparently agreed to when I was very ill when I collapsed so was in no state to agree to anything. I discovered after being at home for two weeks that certain items were missing from my flat including am old passport, a Christmas present and various small items that I would have not missed immediately. After a months or so I had to have a major operation and again found more items missing after I had returned home. I ended up notifying the police who, after hearing the evidence, said that they were satisfied that it was someone with a spare key but didn\\'t have any proof. Prior to that incident I had also had trouble with my bank and for six months my rent wasn\\'t being paid on time. I notified the landlord but when it kept happening he became unpleasant and although the rent was always paid I would receive several texts. Once, he even drove to my flat to tell me that my rent was late, instead of texting or ringing. He always got his full rent, however, and had other properties so was never out of pocket. Even after the banking issues were solved he started complaining about the lack of money, being poor\/old\/ill and I just put it down to his manner but it never stopped him from going on holidays or spending money on his own home. All in all, from the day I moved into that flat until October 2015, I paid a total of \u00a360,200.00 in rent out of which he could have afforded to reduce the trees, solved the damp problems, fix the pantry window and in fact done away with the pantry completely as it was pretty hopeless and done all sorts of other jobs like decorate the flat (it wasn\\'t touched the entire time I was there) yet spent it on himself, his home and boat and family. I did get my deposit back but suspect that this was mainly due to the police being involved in 2014 (one police officer said he would speak to the landlord to ask him if the lock could be changed; this he did but when the landlord had to pay \u00a330 for this he complained to me about the cost despite having several years\\' worth of rent from me which of course easily  covered the cost of the lock. The police officer concerned also told me that I should be careful as he had spoken to the landlord and found him told be \\\"extremely unpleasant\\\".\r\nI would warn anyone about this man and wife team, as well as the downstairs neighbour who still lives there despite claiming that she hates it, and to ensure that have some form of security cameras installed in the flat to record anything untoward and to be on their guard. Never tell the neighbour anything you do or when you\\'re going away, and never discuss the landlord and his wife with her as she will twist your words and it\\'ll get back to the landlord. Better still, think twice before taking this flat on, nice though it is.","1929":null,"1930":null,"1931":"I moved in to this shared accommodation and it was all going well. The landlord was a really lovely guy, polite friendly and made me feel right at home, he had 2 lovely dogs, (although  one sadly passed.) His partner who works and lives away is really lovely too, she would come and stay on occasional weekends. \r\nI really liked staying here, I had to move as I fell pregnant and needed somewhere bigger.","1932":"The property is very cold through winter . especially the kitchen .  There are not enough radiators for the size of the property .  The washing machine is in the attic and it shakes the entire property on a spin cycle,  sometimes it shakes itself loose and then water leaks through the ceiling to the living room. It is listed as having very good broadband but there is no broadband connection at this flat , I have to hotspot my computer to my phone and use data. There is an ongoing fault with the terrestrial tv signal that wasn\\'t resolved in the twelve months I have been here.   The bell rarely works so deliveries are often missed or need to be collected from a depot.  None of the internal doors work properly as doors , they either have huge cracks you can see through or they need to be wedged closed ,with a weighted door stop. There are not enough plug sockets . The entrance stairs to the flat are so narrow I had to have my sofa carved in half to get it up the stairs and round the corner to my living room. \r\nIn truth this property has amazing views but it is in desperate need of updating . I moved in here last year , I was told I needed to leave 3 months ago so the owner could \\\"take some time \\\"with the property.  Only to find out last week that the property is back on the rental market for \u00a3300 more than I currently pay.","1933":"As student hall it is very loud as to be expected but street noise is also very loud especially being so close to University College Hospital.\r\nHad one issue where our sink was blocked and filled with stagnant water. they claimed it was our fault and they couldn\\'t fix it over the weekend despite the fact that they had recently had someone in to unblock the pipes and it had only become blocked after they had visited. Finally agreed to send in a plumber on the saturday after numerous complaints.","1934":"It\\'s nice that the property is new and close to the tube station, however the windows don\\'t open. I\\'ve learned how suffocating that can feel. It has been extremely difficult dealing with the letting agency at this property. I\\'ve moved out over a month ago and they still haven\\'t given my deposit back. I\\'m barely getting any response from them through email or phone call (they don\\'t have a physical office that I could find). The only response I\\'ve gotten is to tell me that I have to show them proof of paid last utility bills. The irony is that there was an additional bill I wasn\\'t informed of until I got it in the mail. There\\'s a communal energy bill for heating and cooling (in addition to the gas and electricity bill). I went to close the account with the provider but they told me that the letting agency has to fill out a confirmation form for them to close the account. But the letting agent is not responding. So, I\\'m stuck in a loophole. It\\'s been extremely frustrating and stressful to say the least.","1935":"Repairs are needed in many areas of the property all items have been reported but in 8 months have still not been resolved. According to the neighbors there has been many tenants in the last few years who have only lived in the property for a matter of months because repairs are not done and to date several issues are still outstanding . We have lived in the property since April 2016 the bath is full of holes and has not been plumbed in since September . Some of the windows require replacing due to age as they can not be fixed .","1936":"There was a large leak from the bathroom to the kitchen that the landlord ignored to the point where mushrooms were growing from the kitchen ceiling directly over the stove. There was a wasps nest in the garden and the landlord refused to get an exterminator in at all. The landlord would not repair the bathroom window that was above an extension roof, which was very possible for people to climb in through, because they dis not want condensation to build in the bathroom. \r\nThe landlord tried to charge one member of the household almost 50% of the rent and also claimed they had not received payment when full 0ayment had been given with evidence to prove so.\r\nWhen they had called a plumber to finally fix an issue we were given exactly six minute notice to be in the house. A household member texted the landlord asking for more notice in the future they received a phone call from the landlords who yelled at them for \\\"having an attitude\\\" and needing to sort \\\"themselves out\\\".\r\nGuarantors were also contacted regarding supposed damages refusing to contact the tenants themselves.\n\r\nDefinitely do NOT recommend that anyone rent this property or any others from this landlord","1937":null,"1938":"Renting a room in the house was a really bad experience, despite it is a nice house with a back garden.\n\r\n- My privacy was violated several time by the landlady that used to ask about my movement, like when I was in or outside of the house or when I was on holiday. This made me feeling controlled.\n\r\n- The WI-FI signal was not reliable and I have solved the issue buying a booster by myself, because the landlady refused to take care of the problem, even if it was guaranteed to me no issue with internet before paying the deposit and signing the contract.\n\r\n- At two different times I cannot have access to the kitchen (between 6 to 9 pm) because the landlady was having dinner with other people and usually the landlady dislikes that I cook at the same time, this means that I had to wait or to eat outside. \n\r\n- The house was cold and not heated properly.\n\r\nI have received the notice because:\r\n1. I usually wake up at 6:30 am to go to work (this means for the landlady turn on the heating system one hour earlier on my request); \r\n2. The landlady complained that in two occasions I had to take the flight early in the morning;\r\n3. I was in the room above the landlady and he use to complain about my steps when I wake up in the morning.","1939":"The house is a shared one. \r\nAdvantages: you can be accepted fast, without all the checking, as long as you can prove that you have an income. \r\nno deposit is asked. \r\nthe rent is quite cheap. \r\nthe landlords (are 2) are very modern and flexible to anything. \r\nall the issues raised were solved very fast and efficient. \n\r\nDisadvantages:  I have mould on my window. Didn\\'t cross through my head how the landlord could solve this, so I didn\\'t bother to tell him. I just took bleach, a cloth and I clean it periodically. \n\r\nThe hoover is not available all the times, I have to ask the cleaner\/landlord to leave it outside. Btw, the cleaner doesn\\'t do very well his job, but the landlord seems to do his best to fix the situation. \n\r\nOverall, the house\\'s quality is acceptable. I would move out only to have an entire flat for me and to be in the same town as my job.","1940":"The flat is beautiful and the location fantastic. It\\'s expensive but would have been worth the money if not for the following.\n\r\nAt the time we rented the landlord was managing the property and that was not a good situation at all. We had a blocked kitchen sink, which would fill up with waste water whenever we used the washing machine or dishwasher. We had to empty this throughout the washing cycle with buckets which we emptied in the upstairs toilet. We emailed the landlord about this regularly and she failed to send someone out to fix it for 6 months. 6 months of not being able to do laundry or dishes without having to run back and forth with a bucket to empty the sink. When she eventually did send someone to fix it, it was shortly before the end of our lease.\n\r\nOn two occasions that we know of she let people into the flat without even notifying us first, let alone asking for our consent which is the legal requirement. We only knew because one of us happened to be working from home at the time and had strangers letting themselves into the flat. Although we cannot know for certain that there were more times we are sure of it due to a random email we got from the landlord about the state of the property (everything was covered in plastic sheets from the decorators that the landlord herself had sent out due to cosmetic damage from a water leak in the above property).\n\r\nShe tried to take more than \u00a31900 out of the deposit for repairs. When asked why\/for an itemised bill for the work she sent a Word document with descriptions of the work (almost all improvements to the property, not repairs) which was not itemised. For months we went back and forth (or \\\"back\\\" only really as she rarely responded to emails) and eventually went to the dispute service associated with our deposit protection scheme. Upon seeing our evidence (photos, videos, emails, the report from the inventory company which the landlord had chosen) and her evidence (the aforementioned Word document and not much else) the dispute service\\'s arbiter granted her \u00a3141. The arbiter agreed that the landlord was charging us to improve\/renovate her property, not repair it. \n\r\nThere are many other incidents like the above that we can describe, I will make them bullet points to not make this too much longer:\r\n-a condition of us signing the tenancy agreement was her removing some furniture items within 2 months of us moving in - she never did during our almost 2 years of living there.\r\n- friendly emails rarely got a response. Firmer emails resulted in very rude\/hostile (in our opinion) responses.\r\n-she did not respond to emails (from us or the letting agents) asking for a reference. This made it very, very difficult for us to secure our next rental property.\n\r\nI would advise caution when renting this flat.","1941":"10 D Printfield Walk is a lovely property with a relatively big living room, kitchen and includes a balcony.

To get hot water in the kitchen you have to run it full blast and risk getting burned. The window above the bathtub won\u2019t stay shut. The ceiling and walls drop chipped paint almost daily.

I had to move all my bedroom things towards the only central wall that was not leaking; I had to move all the bathroom and kitchen items to the hallway and put buckets, pans, and towels. Additionally, the electricity stopped working in most parts of the flat. The landlord refused to make any repairs and said that he would take our deposit if we didn\\'t pay him rent, which we later found was not protected (this is illegal). \n\r\nAfter three months of leaks and no electricity, we decided to move out, and someone else came in, not knowing how bad the conditions were.","1945":"A landlord and letting agent (Smoothlets) that do not understand even the most basic laws regarding renting.

The sofas are disgusting. The living room and kitchen receive almost zero WiFi or phone signal. The ceiling in the living room started leaking and flooded the room because of a burst pipe under the bath above.

However, we were still not allowed to break the contract, despite the false conditions under which it had been let. \r\nAs a result of these issues, the flat is full of damp, which cannot be remedied. \r\nThe washing machine broke 3 months ago, and the landlord has still not replaced it.","1948":null,"1949":"Neighbours below in 15a (Flat 1) are very noisy playing lots of bass boosted music throughout the day and also the night.

The room was good, cannot complain. However, there were certain drawbacks that you can find below:\r\n1. Landlady had a cat, which she keeped \\'on a diet\\'. The animal was always hungry and did not stop meowing even at late night. I could barely sleep sometimes because of that.\r\n1. Live-in landlady did not behave appropriately. I tried to have a dialog with her many times, pointing out some problems around the house which needed to be fixed. As a response she screamed and was swearing in very bad way. Several times she came home very late and if she saw anything around the kitchen or the house she didn\\'t like she started screaming even at midnight or later. For a person, who needs to go to work next morning, that was not very good experience. Next day I normally received SMS from her saying \\'I feel bad about last night. It was an over reaction. I\\'m sorry\\'. And it repeated several times which made me very nervous every time when we were at home at the same time (she didn\\'t work and was almost always in on weekends).\r\n2. The house is very cold in winter, especially my bedroom. The heating is off at night. I bought a room thermometer and it showed 16 degrees sometimes.\r\n3. Wi-fi is super slow. Actually it was not working at all, when landlady used her computer or watched TV in living room. It is impossible to watch movies or skype at home.\r\n4. The fridge was tiny for two people living at the property.\r\n5. Overground trains right opposite the window. They start running around 5.30 and it is difficult to sleep. Additionally, warehouses occupied by delivery companies were opposite my bedroom window. The landlady said it would not be an issue, but actually they worked even on weekends and sometimes very early hours. The independent gallery at the end of the road frequently had late night and very loud parties during the week.\r\n6. All the buses to the center run through very congested areas - Liverpool street station or Old street roundabout. Which made my commute to work very slow and long process.\r\n7. Some items around the house - shaky gate lock, fallen apart kitchen shelves and leaky bath needed urgent repair. But landlady did not listen to any complaints and did not want to invest in the house maintenance.","2014":"Firstly, this rating is meant for Flat 1. The site incorrectly matches Flat 1 to Flat 2 as per the address above.\n\r\nMy honest recommendation is that you do not live here unless you work unusual hours or are deaf. The flat is directly above a bar which plays very loud music constantly. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are hellish with the bass rumbling through both the living room and bedroom untill at least midnight. The bar managers are frankly uncaring and unhelpful with regards to the issue, choosing often to continue playing the music after the bar has closed and arguing when you request that it is either turned down or off. The council is also unhelpful, not responding to noise complaints. As well as the bar below, the property also faces onto a busy A-road and the sound of traffic\/trucks\/sirens etc. can be heard near constantly. Finally the back of the property where the bedroom is, faces onto a small car park. This is apparently a choice spot for teenagers to meet, drink and smoke weed, the smell of which fills the bedroom, as well as a common spot for loud arguments.\n\r\nThe flat itself is quite nice and whilst I liked the area I cannot say the same for my girlfriend. She complained of constantly feeling scared and unsafe particularly as she had to pass the leers and jeers of the patrons of the bar below who, by the way, drink directly outside the front door often blocking it and leaving glasses and cigarette butts there.\n\r\nFinally, with regards to the flat induction process. All went well untill our estate agent lied to us 72 hours before we were due to move in by telling us that we needed to take out contents insurance through their provider before they could release the keys.

The deposit return process was broadly fair in terms of amount returned \u2013 but it was disappointingly drawn-out (beyond the 10-day period stimulated by government guidance). Given these issues (on top of the high rent), it is hard to justify recommending this flat to other prospective renters.","2041":"Renters should be aware that this property is badly maintained by the landlord, who owns multiple flats in the neighbourhood, and the rental agency that is made responsible for ensuring that tenants pay their rent.

Rent is the \\\"priority\\\", health comes second, the message said. No joke.\n\r\nThe flat on 57 Woodbine Street, which is situated in a lively neighbourhood, simply serves to extract rent for the landlord. It is in need of urgent repair, which, perhaps to little surprise, has been admitted by the estate agent\\'s contractor, our own builders and other independent ones. Our trouble with the flat, the landlord and the agent started very early on. To our regret, we ignored the many warning signs (e.g. patronising estate agents, bossy landlords, ambiguous fees, (now illegal) residency checks, etc.). We hope that this review warns potential renters, but also clients of the estate agent and their predatory practices.\n\r\nOur trouble started already on the second day of our tenancy. Water poured down through the ceiling and even lamps (!) onto our PC, books and other possessions (we are seeking damages). The estate agent was very slow to respond to what appeared to have been a leak in the flat above. In fact, the issue was resolved only after the mediation of our neighbour\\'s agency. The agency responsible for the flat sent their contractor many days after. The poor contractor is paid badly and not given the financial means from the landlord to repair anything structurally. Throughout our tenancy, we struggled with mould, damaging our health (claims forthcoming) whilst requests and pleas to offer and install systematic solutions were continuously ignored and even ridiculed (e.g. our names misspelled continuously and, it must be said, very creatively, silly instructions to open the window in the winter etc.). Now, after having left the property, the landlord has tricked us into a deposit dispute, refusing to return it, using all the familiar trickeries. Raising awareness for such extractive practises now has become a principal issue for us, hence our recommendation not to rent this property.\n\r\nIn short, do yourself a big favour, avoid the property and rent from another agency and landlord.

Matt and Antonia are wonderful people and fantastic landlords.","2053":null,"2054":"It was such a bad experience - to the point that I feel obliged to write a review over 3 years later. All sorts of problems from mould to the landlord and his agents randomly trying to come into the property without warning. They also kept doing repairs outside and leaving rubbish in the way.","2055":"Nice little property, well recommended. We shared with other amazing tenants and do not fancy to move anytime soon.","2056":"The property is good but I would suggest to avoid it purely because of the owner. The owner was proactive in resolving the issues faced in the property but had unnecessary nagging at most of the time. We had to face a very harsh checkout process which caused a lot of mental stress due to landlord. This property is owner managed and should be avoided at all cost. If this property comes as agency managed then its a nice flat to live in but should be avoided if its coming from landlord directly. Very overpriced. Other flats in same apartments are less expensive and have much better landlords. The property have issues due to mould and faulty windows so can lead to health issues if you have little kid.","2057":null,"2058":"Constant harassment via text by landlady even though we\\'ve paid the rent on time, every month in full for 5 years. Refused to fix the back door when we had an attempted break in. After five hours of asking her, we ended up getting it fixed ourselves with no response from her after 5pm so our house, with three children inside would have been insecure. \r\nShe\\'s blamed us for the floors shrinking upstairs although it was her not fitting them properly in the first place. \r\nShe\\'s been abusive via text, refuses to answer phone calls, asks the same questions multiple times and when you answer them she messaged again as if you didn\\'t, telling you, you aren\\'t being difficult with her. \r\nWants to do unnecessary work whilst youre still in the property. Paint etc. She isn\\'t a very nice person. Refuses to do any work and we\\'ve done it all ourselves in 5 years."},"comment_time":{"0":null,"1":"07-12-2016 01:29 AM","2":null,"3":"11-04-2018 06:33 AM","4":"28-04-2021 05:19
