They would knock on their ceiling at any time, including very early mornings, waking us up, for no reason. We don\\\\'t snore, we don\\\\'t party in the house, we don\\\\'t have blasting music on, we don\\\\'t watch loud TV and we don\\\\'t do anything at unreasonable times, therefore there is no explanation to the stressful time they\\\\'re making us go through. On top of them complaining to us, there\\\\'s also the fact that we can hear the upstairs tenants very loudly, we fall asleep with the sound of someone snoring in some other apartment, we can hear vibrating phones receiving messages throughout the night from other apartments. The road is fairly quiet. The only year-round noise we have to complain about is the house itself.\",\n",

In three and half years our landlord never inspected the house to see if any upkeep was required in the property and has flagged a multitude of these issues as reasons to not release out deposit.

       "  'comment_body': '•\\tIn an email dated 4.10.15, the landlady said that she would inspect the flat once every 3 months with a week’s notice. Later on, she said that only 24 hours notice was necessary and that it did not have to be at a convenient time for us. She often appeared on a Saturday morning – the most inconvenient time for those that work 9-5, 5 days a week and want to enjoy their free time. Her inspections increased, at one point, to twice a week for two weeks. We cleaned the flat regularly, but she expected the flat to be absolutely spotless – i.e. not lived in. For example, she complained several times about dust on top of the doorframes and watermarks in the sink.\\n\\r\\n•\\tThe landlady would send her brother, who lived in the building, to the flat to inspect it or if we had a problem that needed fixing. He was incredibly rude and unhelpful and not what we signed up for. On one occasion he let himself into our flat without notice. It made me feel incredibly nervous living there on my own (my housemate was away a lot), knowing that he had a key.\\n\\r\\n•\\tIt got to the point that I was scared to be in the flat on my own. My housemate would be away for months at a time for work and I became incredibly anxious living there, knowing that she could come over with only 24hrs notice, and that her brother had a key to the flat. \\r\\n•\\tThe tenancy agreement clearly stated that the landlord/landlady should not infringe upon the tenants ‘quiet enjoyment of the flat’ – she did. \\n\\r\\n•\\tOne Saturday, when the landlady came for an inspection, she was particularly aggressive towards me. She did not realise that my boyfriend was in my bedroom and, when he heard how rude she was being towards me, he politely asked her not to speak to me in that way. She immediately put her hand in his face saying ‘I am not talking to you’ and said that he could never visit the flat again. After this incident, Neda became convinced that we had other people living in the flat. \\n\\r\\n•\\tWhen I was in the process of signing for a new flat, I was asked to give the contact details of my current landlord so that they could provide a reference. I asked the landlady’s permission to do this and she asked me to ring her. On the phone, she said that I had been an awful tenant and that, to give me a good reference would be a lie. However, she said that she also wanted me gone from the flat, and so preceded to blackmail me by saying that she would only give me a good reference if I promised to get the flat professionally cleaned after moving out. Since it had been my intention to do this anyway, I agreed. Needless to say, having said that she would give me a reference, she didn’t and ignored all phone calls and emails from Let Alliance when they tried to contact her for one. As a consequence, I had to provide my previous 6 months of bank statements to prove that I had paid my rent on time.\\n\\n\\r\\nI paid for the flat to be professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy. The plastic sofa had a slight rip on the seam. The DSA advised me that it was fair wear and tear as you can see where the other seam was ripping. However, the landlady said that we had to pay for a new sofa. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme clearly states that: “Landlords should therefore keep in mind that the tenant’s deposit is not to be used like an insurance policy where you might get “full replacement value” or “new for old”.”In the end she asked for £150 towards it, which we paid because, by that point we were exhausted by the back and forth arguing. \\n\\r\\nI would be happy to provide further pictures and emails for evidence.',\n",

We were able to meet the previous tenants in order to give them some mail that had arrived, they had moved locally. They said we should be very careful with the deposit when checking out, we listened but were not sure exactly what the problem was. They did say they were having to fight to get their deposit back. When we left at the end of the tenancy having looked after the property well and left it in better condition than when when we moved in, we then understood what the previous tenants meant.\\n\\r\\nThe landlady did an inspection (before we moved out but when we were not there so could not comment on her observations) and sent a list of issues she wanted to keep money for. This was for most of the £4,500 deposit. We were shocked! We replied with detailed answers to her points however she just did not respond to what she said and continued to press for money. Fortunately we had taken photographs of all issues/marks in the house the day after we moved in - these had been emailed to the landlady at the time, and also when she raised issues upon checkout. We provide detailed explanations on each problem she wanted us to pay for, sent copies of emails with her from during he tenancy, and resent t photographs. However when repkying she chose to ignore our explanations and not respond the points made, to ignore th  photographic evidence and ignore the copies of email correspondence! For example, she wanted money for a wooden island top to be resanded - we even had a photo of the poor condition it was in when we moved in. Landlady said it had been newly sanded and varnished before we moved in - nonsense. She wanted us to pay for an aerial on the roof to be repaired - we had not even had terrestrial TV. Many other items also. It became clear she was just out to get as much money from our deposit as possible and not to consider the evidence supplied. This was very frustrating. Her communication became aggressive and inappropriately unprofessional.\\n\\r\\nThis had to go through the dispute process with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme - we raised a case. It takes a lot of time to be thorough in contesting the landlady\\\\'s dishonesty point by point but the photos and email evidence we had kept every time we communicated with her meant the outcome was we were asked to pay less than £200 from the deposit instead of the £4,000 she wanted. Fortunately the TDS is there to stop dishonest landlords from stealing from tenants and we were protected as a result. I would strongly recommend not renting this property as it seems the landlady tries it on at the end of all tenancies to steal money from tenants\\\\' deposits as they leave (as evidenced by the tenants before us, and us). It\\\\'s sad people like this are still allowed to rent out properties and try to take advantage of people. Fortunately we were prepared so she didn\\\\'t get away with it. Avoid. There are better properties for similar money in the area with far more honest landlords who act with integrity. I hope renters see this and avoid the frustration we went through, at least she didn\\\\'t get away with it in the end.\",\n",

The council Environmental Health had to issue 2 serous warnings in order to have the property repaired appropriately and during the process the landlady was abusive and spiteful to us. We faced a revenge eviction, could not get a reference for our next property despite always paying rent and had to take her to small claims regarding both the improper protection of our deposit and for the disrepair. We won in mediation and the landlady had to pay us compensation. The entire process was stressful and contributed to a long period of ill health following this. I would NOT recommend this property to anyone. Despite it being repaired- at the councils instruction, the landlady is vindictive and does not attend to her property adequately.',\n",
