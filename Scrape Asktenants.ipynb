The property\\\\'s furnishings & facilities are great and we have very rarely experienced any issues with them. Those that have come up have always been fixed or dealt with swiftly. For example, the shower door came loose and a contractor was sent to review and replace it within the space of a week. Communication has always been clear and helpful, for example if window cleaners are present on certain days. The landlord has also been accommodating of our requests, for example with placing some furniture in an on-site storage locker - and has personally helped us with this process. Overall, the property has been excellent and couldn\\\\'t really wish for a better landlord - this has been the most hassle free tenancy I\\\\'ve experienced.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'When moving in, the place was a mess with rubbish from the previous tenants. Among the rubbish was a used condom which would seem rather comedic had this not been the place I would be living in. The mattresses in the property where very dirty, one of the beds was partially broken causing the dirty mattress to slope down in the middle and the one of the headboards had the leather partially torn off. The light bulbs provided did not work and when the same light bulbs where put back in prior to us moving out, Landlord used this as an excuse to deduct from our deposit.\\n\\r\\nThere where mould problems which the landlord,  would not remedy bar telling us to wipe it down with bleach. We were told the kitchen ceiling was to be painted soon after we moved in, however this didn\\\\&#39;t happen for the entire length of out tenancy. We where unable to use the shower due to it leaking through to the kitchen via the ceiling. The washing machines provided broke down several times and where replaced with similarly faulty ones. The lock to the stairs would get jammed preventing access to the property and needed to be removed by a neighbor. The same lock was broken for most of the tenancy.\\n\\r\\nThere often where drug users that would hang out in the stairs leading up to the property who would leave sterile water containers used to prepare drugs for injection laying around on the stairs along with other rubbish. Along side this, the people from the hostel next door along with some neighbors would harass you as you\\\\&#39;re coming home. The people from the hostel and kids of the neighbors would constantly litter on the grassy area outside of the property. The kids living in the area would also leave sweet wrappers in the staircase causing one to always be met with a swarm of flies when entering going up to the property.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'A shared student house owned by an unreliable private landlord who took ages to fix an issue. The drainage in the shower was blocked before we moved in but the landlord put the blame on current tenants and demanded us to pay for the repair. Had issues with refunding deposits. No full tenancy contract was given although being requested, only two pages. A full year rent was required to pay by cash at the beginning of the tenancy and therefore students had no choice but to stay till the end of the contract despite poor housing condition. Cheap rental was especially appealing to new or international students who were new to the area. Students felt threatened as landlord behaved aggresively if students issued complaints about the house condition. The front door of the house which was supposed to serve as the main access to the building was broken and landlord never fixed it. The door for the kitchen of the house leading to the yard was used as the main access and the street at the back of the house was dark. These caused the house relatively unsafe to live in.',\n",

He would make large repairs himself, despite being unqualified to do so, in order to save money. Said repairs were lacking in integrity or sustainability, and were often completed, loudly, in the wee hours of the morning. One such repair involved removing an entire window and not replacing it for two weeks, in the winter, creating a substantial security and health risk.

       "  'comment_body': 'The landlord here will make your experience awful. Firstly he overcharges for the property (like most landlords) but what is cheeky about this landlord is the property not only is a basement with hardly any light, it also comes with problems such as damp, mould & leaking. For a whole 6 months I had to sleep in a bedroom with black mould covering the wall as the landlord took ages to do something about it. What was funny was when we started investigating the room, we could see he had simply painted over other areas where the black mould appeared. He likes to solve his problems with a plaster - minimum costs. What’s worse is when we complain he begins to complain back at us stating we are difficult tenants. However, our complaints were fair, professional and polite. He clearly just didn’t like a group of tenants actually making the effort to try and create change. He actually made my girlfriend feel distressed when interacting with him. At the end of our tenancy he tried to get us to pay for a full professional deep clean (from our own pockets) which costs around £100. However, at the time the new law came in that doesn’t require tenants to do that anymore - so we insisted we would do it ourselves. It took us a lot of arguments to finally get him to back off. He then came to inspect the house after we finished (which was funny because he’d never made the effort to come out to the house when other problems were happening). We had cleaned the house spotless so he had nothing to complain about. I do not recommend this house. It’s not worth it. It’s a basement, with lots of problems, no light and an awful stress inducing landlord. Go waste your money elsewhere!',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The flat is a one double bedroom, with bathroom, open-plan kitchen and living room and a cupboard. It is managed by a letting agency (currently Edward Taub) and the owner does not wish to deal with tenants directly. It is well maintained overall, but in need of TLC and some upgrades. The selling points: it is light thanks to 4 windows. Downsides: drafts, noisy neighbours, difficulty in keeping it warm, yearly rent increases. \\r\\nThe flooring is nice in the corridor and living room, where you find a light wood laminate flooring, and also in the kitchen area, with dark tiles. Where it needs fixing: cracked tiles in the lavatory and extremely consumed carpet in the bedroom. The flat has a C EPC rating on paper but while it does have double glazing, window frames are old and there are drafts from around every window (and from underneath the bath tub!). The flat has two storage heaters (living room and corridor) and one regular heater in the bedroom. Due to the inefficiency of storage heating, the flat results tricky to keep warm (and even more difficult is to replace air during the day, because you\\\\'d lose all heath). The landlord complained that all tenants find them difficult to operate, which is why a third storage heater in the bedroom was replaced with a normal heater. The storage heater in the corridor is positioned directly underneath the opening to the rooftop, which is separated by a flimsy piece of wood (read: the heat goes straight up and is dispersed too easily). Two light fixtures (living room and bedroom) leave holes in the ceiling exposed. The bedroom is a very small double (I could not add a headboard to the bed because it wouldn\\\\'t leave enough room to walk around the bed) with very consumed brown carpet which is clean, but should be replaced as time has clearly eaten it away. A built-in closet completes the room, but a regular closet would have been much better (the closet is awkwardly organized) and could have sliding doors to maximize space) and a big rod with brown curtains. \\r\\nThe bathroom is functional with tub and electric shower and a very old down flow electric heater that looks like something from the 80s (read: never tested due to safety concerns). There are no windows in the bathroom , only a noisy fan connected to the light switch. The living room/kitchen area is nice and the three windows give it plenty of light. The sun hits the window only in the early morning, so it does not help to warm up the rooms. The kitchen has generous cabinet space and has an open plan, with an island against the wall (but not enough counter to use stools). The small fridge unit was replaced at the beginning of the tenancy because the previous tenant had broken the door of the freezer unit. No dishwasher. The washer is a Hotpoint Aquarius WD420 and unfortunately only works with pre-set programs (can\\\\'t select water temperature and speed of spin cycle). The electric hobs are also need tlc: there are no marks whatsoever, so it is hard to figure which way to turn the knobs and some of the indicators telling which hob you\\\\'re using also don\\\\'t work  (all brought up to the attention of letting agency/owner at the beginning of tenancy but owner preferred not to replace it). There is an oven (never used, so can\\\\'t comment on it) and an extractor fan.\\r\\nNeighbours are on the noisy side: nexdoor is a crying baby and a child who loves to scream, including at odd hours (1 am!!!) and downstairs neighbours like to play loud music in the afternoons. Had to call police 3 times in the first year for outside disturbances from the building directly in front of 7 Thurlow. No problems the following year, but expect kids playing football against the walls of the building and smoke seeping through doors and windows even though it is banned. Complained about smell of weed (on a daily basis), but nothing ever done. New storage bin area installed and fenced area for laundry were added after the first year: very nice additions. Some tenants/guests have problems understanding how the magnetic door to the building works (must push a button and then push the door), so it was damaged twice in two years, possibly another reason for the yearly rent increases. \\r\\nAll and all a good temporary accommodation. The letting agency is always willing to help.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Whilst we lived there we had a massive leak which took over 6 months to get sorted, mainly as the landlord and the building manager kept passing responsibility back and forth. This caused a mould issue. When we moved out, we were given a bill for double the deposit held: essentially the landlord had redecorated the house completely and was trying to charge us for it (to a total of more than £3,600). We had to take him to court as he refused to follow the legal guidelines for what is expected for deposit use, and after a year and three months of legal proceedings he agreed to a deal where we paid the £200 pound original deposit offer we had suggested when we moved out, and he returned the rest of the deposit. I would watch out with this property as the landlord is likely to try the same trick of massively inflated deposit requests with any future tenant. His requests were completely baseless, for example trying to charge 250 quid for a bed frame I found online for 50 pounds. It was a long, unpleasant and expensive process and the apartment isn\\\\'t nice enough to justify dealing with a landlord like that.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The house is situated in a nice and quiet area with an allocated parking.  The area is very convenient for a couple with children.  Re locating from the city ( London ) we have been conquered by the conservatory that makes one additional room during the summer ( extremely convenient to dry clothes as the washing machine does not offer the dryer option ).  Unfortunately during the winter ( from November to April ) this additional room can not be used ( to cold and wet to dry clothes ) and unless considering using a heater in the room ( at a cost! ) it won\\\\'t be possible to use that room other than during the daylight.  Except for the conservatory, the hall, the kitchen and the bathroom, all the surface of the house is cover by carpet what is not the most convenient to clean ( particularly with children ).  From our opinion, the mistake is to have installed carpet on the living room were it would have been much more advisable to install laminated floor.  The main issue with that property is the agency managing the property, Simon and Miller in Larkfield ( Maidstone ).  We have a couple of years experience in renting properties but this agency is from far the poorest agency we never had to deal with.  Up to now, they charged us ( the cost have been added to our online account and i assume they are expecting to deduct the costs from our deposit by the end of the tenancy ) for 3 allegedly non necessary requests of assistance charged £72, £40 and £48.  We tried to discuss the issue but we have always been shut down and told we will have to pay.  The attitude of the agency is disdainful and patronizing and is the real hassle of renting this property.  Regarding the repairs, the agency is unable to solve urgent problem efficiently:  when we moved in the property, the sink plug was stuck half closed and it took the agency/ the landlord 9 months to replace it.  We had issue with the lock of the doors between the conservatory and the living room that was not closing and told it won\\\\'t be changed.  We had issue with the front door lock.  We had issue with the oven ( it has just been replaced 3 months after we reported the fault ).  Another important mistake regarding the energy consumption: the thermostat is located in the hall where the ( open ) stairway is located.  Without a permanent manual adjustment, the heating is always working: it\\\\'s too hot upstairs and barely warm downstairs.  I will say the property is a very nice house but the attitude of the managing agency ( Simon and Miller in Larkfield ) is terrific.\",\n",

The flat gets the sun in the morning so quite nice on summer days where the flat faces another block it is a little cooler. There are holiday lettings within the vicinity. The trouble is they can keep you awake late at night and wake you up early in the morning due to residents of these arriving and leaving the car park which is directly beneath the bedroom. The landlord wanted to charge me for things that were on the inventory when I moved in and for cleaning the property when it was vacated. The arbitration service went in my favour. Leaders Poole, who let the property did not fully discuss the no deposit scheme (do no go for this, pay a deposit. You will be better protected). After you leave the letting agents (Leaders) will take ages to answer emails, sometimes over a month. They seem to be only interested in protecting the landlords money and property. I would not recommend renting this property.',\n",

Out of 13 years in living in rented properties this was probably the worst year ive had mainly due to the Landlord. The problems of the house were dealable to a certain extent just I will never rent a property from them again. \\n\\r\\nNext door to the property is a house that can see clearly into the kitchen. For the first few months this wasn\\\\'t a problem but then the house was bought by a live in care home. After that point there were multiple points where loud arguing shouting and swearing could be heard. However its understandable given the situation and lets face it if your living in a city then noisy neighbors are to be expected.\\n\\r\\nWe were also robbed within the first month of living in the property, housemate left the window open went to make a cup of tea to find someone had jumped through the window, grabbed a bunch of laptops and jumped back out again.\\n\\r\\nAlso two kids across the road used to like hanging out of the windows shouting racist abuse at people walking past on a frequent basis.\\n\\r\\nNo parking in the area with heavy congestion and noise as situated next to a busy road.\\n\\r\\nNice garden though.\",\n",

The owner let out the house to us as he was fed up of london and moving out of the country to start a business in another country. He knocked of several £££ from the rent and it was a good deal. A month after we moved in, we started getting regular visits from the police and bailiffs looking for the owner to recover debts. There were lots of letters that came in the name of the owner and his family members which were seized by the police. The police and bailiffs were very polite and did not harass us but we did not want to deal with his mess and have them coming so often looking for the owner. During our moving notice period, we got to know that the owner had missed his mortgage payments and the house was going to be repossessed so it was a good thing we decided to move earlier. We are yet to receive our deposit which was not protected.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': '7 years of loyalty with this landlord. £60,000 in rent paid. To start with he was really good. However. Having been stung by a tennant for £11,000 he took this out on us. During the pandemic he was rude and unsympathetic that our newbuild was not ready and repeatedly asked when we were leaving andvto tell the builders to get a move on (mmmmm pandemic Mr LL).  He had the house on the market and we courteously showed people round ensuring the house was clean. When we moved out he wanted a months rent notice (fair doos) so basicaly he had an empty property for which we were still paying. When we moved in it had old carpets from a previous family and needed painting and decorating but we decided to do this ourselves to a tasteful manner. The property had cheap carpets fixtures and fittings such as fireplace, kitchen and taps. Wooden floor was of good standard. Reported a leak which was promtly fixed but the damage it caused was left. Several windows were full of condensation causing wallpaper to be damp and peel. Front and back door repeatedly leaked when it rained but got told that they are not meant to be water tight (what????) Cheap kitchen kick boards would never stay on. Cheap carpet use to get tangled in the hoover. Pleasant area with pleasant neighbours thankfully because he only put up a 4ft fence to save money. Garden waste bin was full when we moved in, but charged us a years subscription to get it emptied.\\n\\r\\n£0 bond given back and never used a deposit company for us to be able to dispute. Blamed us for the cheap kick boards, wallpaper peeling and nasty carpets.  Used his poor elderly father as a maintenance man even sending him in during a pandemic.\\n\\r\\nI would suggest avoiding this very bitter money grabbing man.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"I had rented the property from Foxtons but the flat was managed by landlady. The landlady was extremely unco-operative and all throughout I found her attitude very unpleasant. The flat was practically uninhabitable with 2 window locks of bedrooms broken and not being able to shut the windows at all. In addition the balcony door handle was broken and the door would not shut properly letting in winds. The showers of both baths were not working. Ensuite shower had a temperature regulation problem and the other had a broken shower. Overall the condition was pretty unpleasant with chipped doors, cupboards, mouldy washing machine, dirty commode and the flat was handed to me unclean. The window used to let in winds and I suffered greatly because of that. Initially she did not agree to do any repairs but after the agent intervened she did fix one shower that was broken, and the window locks were changed in Mid December after 4 months. The balcony door she refused to fix and even acknowledge it to be a problem. The door would not seal cold air and I fell ill with pneumonia for the second time very badly. After this I asked the Foxtons to convey the message to the landlady that either she fixed the door or she lets me break the contract earlier, as the contract didn\\\\'t have a break clause. If I have to stay in that flat in that condition I would complaint to the council. The agent got back to me saying that the lady had agreed to that I could terminate the contract earlier. However upon vacating she had claimed falsely and unjustly about damages that was already there in the first place and for leaving the property unclean. I felt this to be very unfair and dishonest on her part to act like this. Overall I found the flat to be completely unpleasant to live in because of the hostile attitude of the landlady and her issues with repairs and was overpriced. I would rate the property 1 star ⭐ and landlady rating is not even applicable.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Jacks Cottage is a beautiful stone structure with a fascinating history as an ostler\\\\'s attached to the larger house next to it which was a pub and is where the Landlord and Landlady live.\\n\\r\\nIt has been extended and modernised and has space and light in the extended portion but is very cramped upstairs and in the shower room downstairs. The shower room is directly opposite the front door and was full of dirt when I moved in. The bathroom upstairs is very low and also small and had leaks due to poor plumbing.\\n\\r\\nThe location has fantastic scenery, and the towns in the area a joy to visit. You need a car to live here, but two spaces on a new driveway are provided. However, the cottage was very difficult to find due to the lack of a sign at the entrance. It took me eight months to condense the directions into 200 characters to allow delivery drivers to locate the property. It is close to Bristol, but the roads become packed at peak hours. However, this is similar to many other cities. There are always multiple routes into Bristol if there is an accident, and the property is well situated for access to the M4/M5 for longer commutes.\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the road beside the cottage is used by HGV lorries and commuters as a shortcut to avoid a busy junction on the M5. There are also four quarries in the local area, and the road is used 3-4 nights a week for overnight quarry lorry convoys which pass every 20 minutes or so. Being an old building, it had no foundations which meant the convoys were so loud and caused such vibrations that a picture of my children fell off the wall and was severely damaged. The downstairs windows are double glazed, as are the Velux windows in the upstairs bathroom and hall but the bedroom windows are very old and single paned due to health and safety fire rules.\\n\\r\\nAlthough the property seemed clean inside, when I looked closer after moving in, it was filthy behind the cooker, the shower required days of work to even get it to a point where I could use it.\\n\\r\\nThe heating is oil based, and your bills will fluctuate with oil prices, it also more work monitoring oil levels and ordering deliveries. The property was tough to keep at a constant temperature due to incorrect radiator sizing and lack of central room thermostat. Despite offering to have one installed by my brother for free, the landlord and landlady prevaricated and would not accept that the cottage needed one. My brother is a 25-year heating and airconditioning technical expert who runs his own company, and the local heating engineer even mentioned that he could not understand why they did not install central thermostats in the cottage or the main house and then complained that the heating was expensive and that breakdowns were regular. A central thermostat would have mitigated both of these problems.\\n\\r\\nThere is a tiny garden with astroturf, but it is very private with a large stone wall around it.\\n\\r\\nThe lighting is mostly spotlights, banks of 4 in each bedroom upstairs. Personally, I think the lighting design is not good. Too bright and direct but that is a subjective opinion. I replaced many halogen bulbs with LED equivalents out of my pocket due to the cost and heat generated having them on. \\n\\r\\nThe landlord and landlady, while being pleasant, were both working full time. Thereofre, any request for minor repairs was not attended to or repaired poorly by themselves or me. They did not want to spend the money on professional workmen for interior maintenance. Their amateur attitude was also a factor in the cleanliness of the property was not subject to deep cleaning for many years over many tenancies. \\n\\r\\nAs I expected the owners tried to take a good portion of the deposit from me, that was due to damage caused by issues I had verbally pointed out but were not resolved. I won the Deposit Protection Scheme arbitration that I entered due to problems with the contract and their lack of reactivity when I mentioned issues. I recommend you very carefully check everything on their manual list of the state of the interior.In addition, take photo\\\\'s of every room, every item, in every cupboard and behind every appliance if you decide to move in. When raising issues, make sure they are via email or in writing and keep them for future proof.\\n\\r\\nThe privacy is severely lacking due to the main house right next to you. I noticed I was being watched but ignored it until multiple visitors mentioned it to me. I suggest you get net curtains, which of course darkens the property as the sun shines through the windows on the side of the cottage where the main building is located.\\n\\r\\nMy overall experience was generally very poor, and caused me incredible extra stress that I did not need at that time.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'We wrote this letter to the landlord when we terminated our tenancy. To our knowledge, the landlord is not planning to make any changes or refurbishments to these items. \\n\\r\\nOur letter:\\n\\r\\n\\\\\"We’ve noticed the following issues in the unit that have arisen from normal wear and tear or defects in furnishings, which you might want to consider before re-letting:\\n\\r\\n- The damp in the corner of the bedroom (refer to earlier communication) still appears to be soaking through the walls. Perhaps this is still damp from the earlier leak. Regardless, real issue is that mould is still growing inside the walls. It is still possible to smell the mould and damp. (My wife was diagnosed with adult-onset asthma only after this damp appeared, and her ongoing breathing difficulties appear to be triggered by the black mould in the bedroom). The mouldy wall is a health and safety concern.\\n\\r\\n-The carpet in the unit is very worn, especially around doorsills. It is fraying at many places where the carpet meets the walls, and where the carpet meets the doors, in multiple rooms. There was a duct-taped section keeping the carpet together when we first moved to the property, and now we have added several duct-tape additions of our own in places where opening doors pull at the carpet. This has been necessary to keep the carpet from getting caught under doors and fraying further.\\n\\r\\n-Many other interior doors do not close properly, particularly the door to the bedroom with the round wall and the lounge with the fireplace.\\n\\r\\n- The tray containing the electric hobs in the kitchen, which once fell out of position (refer to our earlier communication about this problem), has been imperfectly reinstalled and sits somewhat lower than it should. This creates a problem where the heating elements do not sit flush with the glass, making the heat uneven and cooking more difficult.\\n\\r\\n- The boiler spontaneously shuts off from time to time, frequently requiring the relight button to be pressed. This is particularly an issue when it goes off in the night, leaving the house without heat while we are sleeping. \\n\\r\\n- The freezer door latch has broken, making the freezer not close properly and resulting in frost buildup. Normal defrosting does not seem to solve the problem. It is nearly impossible to use the freezer, and the open freezer compartment makes the refrigerator section too cold. \\n\\r\\n- The washing machine sometimes apparently does not receive sufficient water, causing the wash cycle to frequently stop with a “tap closed” error. \\n\\r\\n- The bathroom sink had a stuck drain which was partially repaired, but we were instructed not to close the drain until further repairs could be made.\\n\\r\\n- A smell often comes out of the bathroom sink when you use the taps. Your handyman told us at one point that this was normal, but the smell is quite strong and sulfuric, and only comes when you turn on the water. \\n\\r\\n- The right knob on the bathroom sink has been gradually reducing the amount of water it will deliver from the tap. Over the last few months it’s gone from letting out about half of what the left knob will deliver, to just a trickle of water. Right now almost no water comes out of the right knob when you turn it.\\\\\"\\n\\r\\n--\\n\\r\\nIn addition this letter, it should be noted that most of the windows do not shut properly (the flat is part of a historic house, and the windows are original and not double glazed), and insects regularly fly into the flat, since it\\\\\\'s surrounded by parkland on three sides. We\\\\\\'ve had particular problems with wasps and spiders.\\n\\r\\nOn the positive side, the landlord is very quick at responding to emails. However, he is very slow to make any necessary updates to the property. In the first instance, he will come personally or send a handyman to see what kind of \\\\\"patch\\\\\" can be made. If he can\\\\\\'t figure out a good quick-fix or patch for the problem, then you should expect a long delay for a fix (for example, two weeks for a new washing machine for us, and he\\\\\\'s never corrected a problem with the sink).\\n\\r\\nAn example: the old hobs in the very old hob/oven unit (probably last updated in the 1970s)  *collapsed and fell through the oven* earlier this year. Instead of fixing the unit, his handyman patched the hob by rigging it sloppily back up under the glass. Now the hobs don\\\\\\'t sit straight, so it\\\\\\'s really difficult to cook (and not all of the cooking options on the hob/oven unit worked in the first place). This is an example of a \\\\\"patch\\\\\" job.\\n\\r\\nYet another example - and the most critical one - when a damp issue was identified, and black mould was found growing on the walls in the master bedroom, the landlord simply had his handyman come over and slap stain remover and paint on the problem. The water leaked through over and over again, and the mould kept growing. This led to me developing asthma and breathing problems (as noted on the list above). To this date, the landlord seems to have no plan to actually fix the problem, and merely keeps having his handyman come by and hide the mould and damp stains under another coat of paint. It\\\\\\'s a serious health and safety problem.\\n\\r\\nFinal example - the carpet is ancient. When we moved into the property (as mentioned above), we noticed the carpet was already old, that it was fraying where the doors close, and that there was grey tape keeping some of the carpet in place. Fast forward to now - the carpet is of course worse after another year and eight months of wear and tear. It\\\\\\'s frayed or pulling back, revealing the plywood underneath, when you close nearly all of the doors. Despite being on its last leg, it\\\\\\'s clear the landlord wants us to keep the old carpet for his next tenant. When we noted that the carpet was really old and frayed (and frankly disgusting as well), he just sent in a handyman to add more tape to tape the carpet down under the doors - but, hey, it\\\\\\'s black tape this time! This is especially frustrating in our last days of the tenancy, since obviously the doors still pull at the carpet which is now covered in black tape, and of course the tape is sticky and it catches to the door when we close them. So this tape \\\\\"patch\\\\\" has just left us with a sticky mess and even more frayed carpet. I can\\\\\\'t imagine how he thinks the next tenant will be okay with living with taped-down carpet.\\n\\r\\nThese are just illustrations of how the landlord \\\\\"does business.\\\\\" When the paint peels or a crack appears, he sends in a handyman who does a pretty sloppy job. When our rent is 2800 pounds a month, you\\\\\\'d expect he could move a bit quicker and afford a new washing machine or hob or carpet...\\n\\r\\nFinally, to add insult to injury, when the estate agent started showing prospective tenants to the flat this week, the tenants were of course turned off by the flat. Our landlord had the nerve to write me this letter, insulting us and presuming that *we* were to blame for the flat not being rented on its first viewing:  \\r\\n\\\\\"please can I ask that you keep the property tidy and presentable for any viewings (as I am sure you will do in any case!) so that I can tie up a re-let ASAP and minimise the need for further viewings which will be to our mutual benefit.\\\\\"\\n\\r\\nI of course responded: \\\\\"Our house was impeccably clean when the last visitation took place, and it will be for any further viewings. As we were present during the last viewing, we heard the prospective tenant make comments about the condition of the property, particularly the frayed carpet that Trevor has taped, and noticed that the flat has not been updated recently. We are always committed to keeping and presenting a tidy flat.\\\\\"\\n\\r\\nSo, tenants beware: if you rent this property, your landlord will not only refuse to maintain it, but he expects you to pay a luxury rent for a run-down place, and will blame *you* no one wants to rent it after you.\\n\\r\\nIn sum, the landlord runs this property like a cheap hostel but wants to charge a luxury rent. After he raised our rent this year, were left paying an exorbitant rent of 2800 pounds - and we felt stuck there because we had a newborn baby and were desperate not to move. As soon as we got our bearings, we went out and searched the market and found newly refurbished (clean and HEALTHY) properties in as great locations for 800 pounds less a month. We immediately terminated our lease using the break clause as soon as we found a new living situation. \\n\\r\\nWe\\\\\\'ve since learned that our landlord expects to fetch a rent of 3500 pounds a month for the place. We find this shocking.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'I wish I\\\\\\'d known about this service when we actually moved out over 2 years ago, because it may have changed hands now. The landlord was elderly and liked talking about the war, but that was no excuse for the disrepair of this property and his refusal and excuses to help.\\n\\r\\nWe spent 26 months in this property and I\\\\\\'m going to list just some of the issues that still stick out to me now after all this time;\\r\\n- There was mold throughout the property, mainly in the bathroom, kitchen and small bedroom. To address it an extractor fan was installed in the bathroom. Previously, there was a hole in the wall in preparation of a fan, but no actual fan installed. An extractor was added to the drier in the kitchen. Previously it had just been pumping out all that steam into the kitchen. These 2 amends did not solve the issue. \\r\\n- The landlord would enter the property without warning and without us present. I once came home from work to find the property stinking. It turned out he\\\\\\'d been round to spray mould remover on the walls, but didn\\\\\\'t then wash it off. \\r\\n- The living room window was installed upside down. As a result, you need to get a ladder to climb up and release the lock in order to close it once open. As this is a first floor flat, this is dangerous. His fix for this was to permanently seal it shut using the same sealant you would generally use in the bathroom. \\r\\n- The carpets had holes in them, paint splatter on them, and weren\\\\\\'t tacked down. Where they were tacked down, in doorways for example, they were loose and we would literally cut out feet or rip our socks on them, so you have to wear shoes or slippers at all times. \\r\\n- There\\\\\\'s a rotting mattress in the garden. We were assured it would be removed when we moved in, but it was still there when we moved out. \\r\\n- The 2 sheds were overflowing with the previous tenants belongings, including a sofa when we moved in. These were emptied, initially... \\r\\n- The attic was also full to the brim. To empty this, he sent round a gardener with a van. The van wasn\\\\\\'t big enough. So, we helped the man fill the van (this would have been an impossible one man job, as the attic access was just a hatch and he was having to move wardrobes, doors, tables etc). Once the van was full, we then stuffed the overflow into the sheds, and that still only cleared half the attic space, which at least allowed us to store a few bits.\\r\\n- The landlord was a bully. He would have me in tears when he came round, telling me how difficult I was making his life because I had asked for the mould issue to be resolved. I told him I was getting ill. He would just raise his voice. So we left. 4 months later I had my cancer diagnosis. Mould (as far as I know) doesn\\\\\\'t cause cancer, but I do believe if I\\\\\\'d have been forced to remain in that house through chemo, I probably would have died.\\r\\n- He sent a roofer to look at the living room window, who unsurprisingly wasn\\\\\\'t able to fix it. He sent a gardener to look at the roof. He sent an electrician to look at the boiler. It was as if he was determined to not fix anything, but to look like he was trying and just \\\\\"couldn\\\\\\'t find the right people\\\\\".\\r\\n- We were told we could use the drive out front. You can\\\\\\'t. It belongs to the lady who lives downstairs. Street parking is scares. After a month there I gave up and sold my car. \\r\\n- Plug sockets, light switches and the thermostat were painted over. The sockets were literally full of paint, so half of them didn\\\\\\'t work. One had blown completely. There was evidence of burning and melting and the live wire just left. Other sockets had been illegally installed, as we found out after an inspection, and the illegal fittings were removed, which further halfed our plug capacity in the living room. He never fixed the thermostat. \\r\\n- The oven was an electric oven, but used a regular plug socket, which you could literally feel heat up as you used it. This oven did break while we were tenants, which we then replaced with a safe gas cooker. \\r\\n- The boiler was condemned and no action was taken.\\r\\n- At some point in the past the living room had been wall papered. By the time we moved in, the wall paper had been painted over in a garish green. We wondered why. Then realised it was because there were in total 5 fist sized holes in the wall, that had been ductaped over and then the walls painted.\\r\\n- The fireplace had been stuffed with rubbish and then sealed shut with cardboard and ductaped. I literally don\\\\\\'t even know how they achieved that one. \\n\\r\\nBasically, this property is an absolute disaster and this man shouldn\\\\\\'t be allowed to be a landlord. \\n\\r\\nThere were plenty of other, smaller issues that we fixed ourselves, and we managed the mould issue with a lot of regular scrubbing. Overall, the property was in a much better state when we left than when we moved in. Despite this, he tried to keep £800 of the £1250 deposit. We argued and provided photographic evidence in a very lengthy document to the deposit protection scheme and in the end this was reduced to just £40 - because we left a perfectly good BBQ behind! The £40 was apparently for the removal of this item, despite the fact it would have cost him nothing to either a) take it to a skip, b) offered it to the next tenants or c) bulked it in with the removal of the rotting mattress, the contents of the sheds and the remaining contents of the attic. Still, this was a battle I didn\\\\\\'t need while dealing with breast cancer and we did well to recover the majority of our deposit back.\\n\\r\\nIf you have any other option available to you, I would recommend you avoid this house.',\n",

The bathroom was perfectly proportioned for the size of the flat and didn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t feel pokey or cramped - the P shaped bath really made the best use of the space! The kitchen is small but perfectly formed, plenty of space to store the essentials - we sometimes found the fridge/freezer a struggle (under cabinet size only) after a big shop, but with a bit of careful arrangement it easily housed enough food for two! The living room was a great size and the compact table was perfect for space saving.Our favourite feature of the flat was the wall of shelving! This was an amazing use of the space and gave us all the storage we needed! We love the area (we bought a place across the park from Coleman Court) but as any Londoner will tell you no area is perfect - but we really never had any problems that affected us personally. Transport links are amazing - Southfields tube is a short walk as is Earlsfield mainline station. The local area provides everything you could need in terms of shops, eateries and bars/pubs, and leisure. We found contacting our landlord very easy - She was always fast to respond to emails or calls, and resolved any issues we had very quickly! We can highly recommend this flat!\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Christopher engaged in unscrupulous tactics to evict us with less than the required notice by negotiating for a new tenancy with a replacement of tenants, then pulling the offer once referencing was done. He then proceeded to blackmail us into giving up an enormous portion of the deposit even though (after 7 years of the property being let since the last inventory was done) he was entitled to relatively little. Chris could not be reasoned with by explaining to him how betterment works under the UK law, and his only responses were to tell us how bored he was of our requests, aggressive messages highlighting random sections of the tenancy agreement and threats of legal action. He cannot be reasoned with and, like many landlords, his greed became all too apparent at the end of the tenancy. I suggest that Chris takes a hard look in the mirror to consider why he should take tenants cash for basic maintenance (like painting a wall long after it’s usable life span is up) rather than paying for it out of the roughly £280k he has collected in rent since the last time these jobs were done. He also didn’t want to replace things like broken fridge shelves that on the original (seven year old) inventory were showing cracks due to age and repair. He was, however, generally good with other items of repair (such as when plumbing broke and the bathroom flooded) although I suspect that was only because that threatened the material value of the home. Never did one inspection in all the time we lived there either. In short, parasitic and partially absent landlord who views the house as a passive source of guaranteed cash rather than something to be genuinely lived in and then later maintained by him on the basis it’s an investment.',\n",

The council Environmental Health had to issue 2 serous warnings in order to have the property repaired appropriately and during the process the landlady was abusive and spiteful to us. We faced a revenge eviction, could not get a reference for our next property despite always paying rent and had to take her to small claims regarding both the improper protection of our deposit and for the disrepair. We won in mediation and the landlady had to pay us compensation. The entire process was stressful and contributed to a long period of ill health following this.

They turn this from being accommodation to being a home.  Eternally friendly and welcoming, they run superb social events so everyone gets to know each other but never intrusively so - if you just want to keep yourself to yourself then that\\\\'s equally fine.  I\\\\'ve recently been very ill due to two operations and the building team have been like family, always there, always genuinely helpful and made sure I never felt alone.

I mentioned I needed to register at the city council which I did. The property was not registered as a flatshare so agents started an investigation. They discovered that the name of the landlord doesn\\\\'t match with the home address he gave. We also faced electric issue. The heater didn\\\\'t work so we received an electric one for our room. Because of the electricity issues, it was cut off regularly and we had to go downstairs to put it back on. Thing is, we didn\\\\'t have the key to go downstairs qt first so our food in the fridge and freezer turned bad. Also, the switch didn\\\\'t make sense so we had to use our flashlights sometime to find our way around. Some sockets were missing that it was impossible to vacuum the living room. The house was also badly painted, especially for the details. I met a Romanian worker who live in another property from this landlord. He told me that he was rushed to finish quickly and roughly the house work. The landlord blamed me for not being British (he is from China). As mentioned here above, we also had mould issue that was covered up with the painting and leak that was poorly repaired. The landlord contacted us only to get his rent but didn\\\\'t get any repairs done. He was coming back and forth in the house with other people without 24h notice. He also randomly decided to add public lights in the property. So we had a constant green light in or ceiling.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"It was such a shame about this property.  Cute little mews terrace in a good area in Central London.  How is is ruined by its internal condition and an unfair Landlord.\\n\\r\\nFirst warning, the front room suffers from damp issues - especially in winter as the temperature drops (no i did not dry clothes in the room).  Despite keeping windows ajar every day I was still required to do a deep clean with strong mould spray every so often.  I lost several pairs of shoes and clothes to the mould issue.  Despige flagging this with the landlord several times, promises were made and nothing that made a vast change was done (only a replastering of a cupboard).\\n\\r\\nThe landlord\\\\'s handyman on retainers informed me that the house does not have any insulation!  So be weary!\\n\\r\\nThe Landlord was also cheap - instead of hiring qualified professionals to do a job the handyman on retainer was always used.\\n\\r\\nWithin 6 months of moving in the roof terrace was causing issues for the other flatmate (there was a whole in the roof above the room ceiling!).  Said handyman was brought in to fix.  A year later, the roof collapsed without warning!  Again landlord used said handyman instead of getting professionals/properly fixing the roof.\\n\\r\\nThe property could do with some revamping, quite old internal wiring, kitchen and kitchen appliances are out of date and bathroom could d with a revamp.\\n\\r\\nLandlord takes quite cheap options so the same problems just spring up again.  Despite trying to be professional and amicable to Landlord they are just a sneak underneath the nice act.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Point one has to be that the property is infested with mice. We made the landlord aware of the issue and they told us that it was our problem to solve. We tried to capture them all but there are so many that they kept coming back.\\n\\r\\nThe property is made to look okay but once you move in you find all sorts of problem. all repairs are done on the cheap for example the living room floor is uneven. it slants to back of the room. The kitchen floor has cheap bathroom lino on it so that when you put your fridge and washing machine down it tears it. the side is none scratch resistant or heat proof, it was all warn out by the time we moved out, top room was un-usable in winter because there is a hole in the wall to the outside covered with a plastics grate - kitchen floor poorly fitted holes connected to the basement, cold drafts- basement door has hole at the top letting in draft. - loads of spiders coming from basement, enough to constitute an infestation. This is not all but I feel these are the main points.\\n\\r\\nThe landlord tried to take all but 9% of our bond off us, lots of reasons given,  I challenged this through the bond scheme and managed to get 75% back the loss was mainly on the cleaning and a few scrapes and scratches. It underlines the importance of taking pictures when you move in. I believe that the we could have gotten more back if we had done this.\\n\\r\\nIt is not all doom and gloom the landlords do repairs quickly if they are cheap - they use unskilled work men though.\\n\\r\\nThe boiler broke down in November 2018 - and to their credit they replaced it. But it took a month for them to do this in a house with a 1 year old.',\n",

The landlords insisted it wasn\\\\'t clean, blamed me for existing damage, duplicated charges, and asked for disproportionate deductions through the letting agent.

The space is comfortable and convenient for one person - it would be cramped for two, and storage space is very limited. Issues have been minor but the landlord is not willing to do any upkeep on the flat so there are blocked plugs, cupboards that don\\\\'t shut, a broken light switch (though I got this fixed privately) etc. There is also a persistent damp/musty smell that can\\\\'t be cleaned out. I\\\\'d recommend figuring out what\\\\'s wrong before you move in and asking that it\\\\'s fixed beforehand. On the other hand, these issues are quite minor and the contractor taking care of the building is great, so bigger issues like the building plumbing get sorted out quickly.\",\n",

We found major issues with ripped flooring and severe limescale problems which we reported, as they didn\\\\'t appear on the condition report. These still weren\\\\'t added and the Landlord even tried to charge us over £500.00 for these issues at the end of the tenancy! Luckily we had kept the written proof that we had reported these for the deposit protection company. We paid a lot extra for the deposit as we have a pet cat and didn\\\\'t have an issue with this, as our cat is clean and uses a litter tray indoors. After the tenancy, we were charged for pet urine (not even cat) on the carpet, which is a stain that was there when we moved in, we also lost lots of deposit money for the redecoration of the property, which was already tired looking when we moved in and was left in exactly the same condition. We reported a dangerous loft hatch which wasn\\\\'t fixed properly and kept falling down, we were advised that the landlord would have their handyman repair it, but this never happened.I would just recommend to any tenant wishing to take on this property, definitely take your own photos when you move in, and take departure photos too, otherwise you could lose most of your deposit.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Possibly the worst property I’ve ever rented – I would have moved out sooner but could not afford tenancy fees and moving costs and as such was stuck in the property for longer than I had planned. \\n\\r\\nOn first inspection, the property appeared nice, clean and in good working order. It was not until we had our first check-in that litany of issues with the apartment became apparent. Most of the light fixtures did not work, the taps were non-functioning, the toilet was blocked, the heating did not work, the fridge and oven were broken, the storage spaces were filled with junk (mostly broken furniture, building materials and old, Urdu-language VHS tapes!), the electricity was on a key-meter and this had not been topped up (meaning the inspection was done in the dark), the locks were broken on the front door, several electricity sockets were non-functioning, even the furniture that was provided was dirty and damaged, but had been cleverly presented in a way that meant this was not obvious until closer inspection. As we had moved down from Manchester to move into this property we had arrived late on a Saturday afternoon and the letting agents, Winkworth New Cross, were finishing for the day by this point. When I called them and told them about all of these issues they were reluctant to do anything until Monday morning and it took a significant amount of arguing to get them to agree to send out an emergency repairman (I believe it was when I pointed out that I would not be able to go to the bathroom that they finally acquiesced). To top it all off, after the first night we awoke completely covered in bed-bug bites! \\n\\r\\nFirst thing on Monday I presented to Winkworth’s office with an extensive list of issues that required fixing. They acted sympathetic and promised to get everything sorted but it took the best part of a month before all of the issues were resolved (at least they agreed to replace the bed and have the place fumigated as soon as possible!)\\n\\r\\nSadly, this experience set the tone for the rest of the tenancy and we experienced various issues throughout our stay. Mould quickly built up around the windows despite them being left open (it did not help that the seals on the double glazing had perished on nearly every single window, thus allowing damp to accumulate in and around them). Winkworth were quick to blame us for this but on closer inspection I found evidence that mould had been present in the property for a while and the previous tenant (or Winkworth) had simply painted over it. The heating system was an electric boiler which, aside from being highly inefficient and expensive, broken down every few weeks – the landlord refused to replace it and instead had every single part of it replaced using second-had parts (sadly this made for a lot of cold showers in the winter). One month after moving in, the wall-mounted shelves that the landlord had provided fell off the wall, destroying everything that was on or under them. The agents were quick to send the repairman out on this occasion to remove them and fix the holes they had left in the wall and, on inspection, he asserted that these were ‘not weight-bearing shelves’ as the wall was too soft to support such weight. \\n\\r\\nEventually the landlord tired of having to pay for these various repairs and, cleverly, told the agents that repairs could only be carried out with his permission and then began ignoring their attempts to contact him. \\n\\r\\nThe building itself was an odd, 50/50 mix of perfectly nice people and anti-social reprobates which meant we were frequently disturbed by loud parties, domestic disputes and the occasional police raid. In fairness, the company managing the property were fairly helpful in dealing with anti-social tenants but as soon as such one group was evicted another would take their place. The neighbourhood was of a similar character and their would often be incidents of petty crime, anti-social behaviour and even gang-fights and fatal stabbings in the immediate vicinity. Indeed, I was once woken up at 4am on a Tuesday by the sound of 6 large men having a melee immediately outside our bedroom window. \\n\\r\\nWhen I finally left the property I had to spend 6 weeks arguing with Winkworth regarding the deposit. It was 14 days before they eventually replied to my enquires – I pointed out that at this point they were legally obligated to return my deposit without deductions but apparently they were unfamiliar with basic tenancy law. They demanded to know where the aforementioned, non-weight bearing shelves were – they had no record of them falling down and demanded I pay for them. They demanded to know where all the broken furniture from the storage spaces were – again, they had no record of agreeing to remove them as they were clearly beyond repair. They then insisted that the property, having now been empty for 3 weeks since I left, had become dusty and needed a full professional clean which I should pay for. Eventually, following the exchange of some very loud words and threats of litigation, they backed down and returned my deposit in full. \\n\\r\\nTo cut a very long story short – avoid this property and its agents if you can. The amount of rent they charge for a property of this type, in this neighbourhood, is exorbitant and you can get far more for your money (and live in a much nicer area) if you look slightly further away from the city centre.  \\n\\r\\nEdit: Apologies for the formatting, this site doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t seem to allow paragraphs.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The property is an old Victorian house with major rodent problem. Some aspects of the house is new but some are very old like the crevices in the wall, hole in the toilet wall from where the surveyors thought the rodents were entering the house. The rodent menace eventually got so bad that it required deep cleaning every week. Landlady was not cooperative enough as she got the pest control to place only mouse traps, which we already did ourselves. The house needs proper pest control. There were other issues such as very old appliances like fridge (we had to buy our own to survive) , leaking washing machine which we eventually got replaced, main door lock was faulty. Also no exhaust in the bathroom. Worst landlord ever !! Don\\\\'t rent this property please!\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': '•\\tIn an email dated 4.10.15, the landlady said that she would inspect the flat once every 3 months with a week’s notice. Later on, she said that only 24 hours notice was necessary and that it did not have to be at a convenient time for us. She often appeared on a Saturday morning – the most inconvenient time for those that work 9-5, 5 days a week and want to enjoy their free time. Her inspections increased, at one point, to twice a week for two weeks. We cleaned the flat regularly, but she expected the flat to be absolutely spotless – i.e. not lived in. For example, she complained several times about dust on top of the doorframes and watermarks in the sink.\\n\\r\\n•\\tThe landlady would send her brother, who lived in the building, to the flat to inspect it or if we had a problem that needed fixing. He was incredibly rude and unhelpful and not what we signed up for. On one occasion he let himself into our flat without notice. It made me feel incredibly nervous living there on my own (my housemate was away a lot), knowing that he had a key.\\n\\r\\n•\\tIt got to the point that I was scared to be in the flat on my own. My housemate would be away for months at a time for work and I became incredibly anxious living there, knowing that she could come over with only 24hrs notice, and that her brother had a key to the flat. \\r\\n•\\tThe tenancy agreement clearly stated that the landlord/landlady should not infringe upon the tenants ‘quiet enjoyment of the flat’ – she did. \\n\\r\\n•\\tOne Saturday, when the landlady came for an inspection, she was particularly aggressive towards me. She did not realise that my boyfriend was in my bedroom and, when he heard how rude she was being towards me, he politely asked her not to speak to me in that way. She immediately put her hand in his face saying ‘I am not talking to you’ and said that he could never visit the flat again. After this incident, Neda became convinced that we had other people living in the flat. \\n\\r\\n•\\tWhen I was in the process of signing for a new flat, I was asked to give the contact details of my current landlord so that they could provide a reference. I asked the landlady’s permission to do this and she asked me to ring her. On the phone, she said that I had been an awful tenant and that, to give me a good reference would be a lie. However, she said that she also wanted me gone from the flat, and so preceded to blackmail me by saying that she would only give me a good reference if I promised to get the flat professionally cleaned after moving out. Since it had been my intention to do this anyway, I agreed. Needless to say, having said that she would give me a reference, she didn’t and ignored all phone calls and emails from Let Alliance when they tried to contact her for one. As a consequence, I had to provide my previous 6 months of bank statements to prove that I had paid my rent on time.\\n\\n\\r\\nI paid for the flat to be professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy. The plastic sofa had a slight rip on the seam. The DSA advised me that it was fair wear and tear as you can see where the other seam was ripping. However, the landlady said that we had to pay for a new sofa. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme clearly states that: “Landlords should therefore keep in mind that the tenant’s deposit is not to be used like an insurance policy where you might get “full replacement value” or “new for old”.”In the end she asked for £150 towards it, which we paid because, by that point we were exhausted by the back and forth arguing. \\n\\r\\nI would be happy to provide further pictures and emails for evidence.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'A relatively well renovated council flat with well designed rooms. Contains a hallway with one bathroom, one bedroom, a living room and a kitchen. Also was a fully furnished flat, which was helpful at the time. Unfortunately the living room is stocked with mainly glass furniture which are easily breakable, some were already broken when I moved in. \\n\\r\\nAlso months into the tenancy, I could see that although it looked superficially well done, it wasn’t of high quality as hallway linoleum floor slats moved frequently and exposed the bare wooden floor underneath, the kitchen had holes everywhere in the corners of the floor and the there were and are an abundance of spiders and other insects especially at the front door and outside of the property which was extremely dirty and kept in poor condition. \\n\\r\\n2 months into the tenancy, discovered an issue with the kitchen taps and no release of hot water which went on for almost a year as it was tried to be fixed by several different engineers. The boiler broke down twice leaving me freezing and unable to shower in the middle of winter that my mother had to drive all the way from London just to provide me with an electric heater (as I am disabled), and there were issues with the electricity and the toilet.\\n\\r\\nI was told by several engineers that visited the property that the tank and water system are ancient and belong in antiquity which is why they had a tendency to break down every few months. A complete overhaul of the tank and water system would be needed but the landlord unwilling to fork out for such a cost, refused to follow their recommendations.\\n\\r\\nRegarding the landlord, she was a very vindictive landlord who took an instant dislike to me because I reported and chased up all the repair issues needed in the flat. She appeared to be content with me living in a flat paying a very high amount of money which she increased after a year without any dispute from me yet I couldn’t use hot water in the kitchen taps. Halfway through the tenancy during a particularly bad repair issue whereby I had no heating for a few days, my mother tried to call and speak to reason with her and she cut the phone on her and refused to engage with me directly since then, only going through the agent.\\n\\r\\nShe made a point at the start of the tenancy to make me take down her number and message her if there were any issues, but when I proceeded to do just that she appeared annoyed and implied that I should only be contacting the estate agency so as not to disturb her. \\n\\r\\nWorse of all, she came every few months to pick up her mail which she failed to redirect, so I had to separate my mail from hers and she would drop by at any time usually only giving me a few hours notice to collect her mail.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Really disappointed. Definitely not recommended. The price was high to start with but we unfortunately had ran out of other options. The landlords became more hostile as the tenancy progressed, as they seemed to be reasonable at first but gradually and by the end of the tenancy seemed to turn unfairly sour and expected unreasonable levels of strict behaviour and cleanliness far above and beyond what the flat was like at the start of the tenancy and we had to fight to get our sizeable deposit back, even with deductions. The paperwork/process in general was quite disoncerting with little assurance that our payments were actually going where they were meant to. The landlords were pretty rude and unfair about us during and especially after leaving in correspondence. Even though it is advertised as being appropriate for students, any levels of noise or disruption or cleanliness less than completely pristine were not well tolerated so we would not recommend this for students. We also felt misled by the fact that we found it on a large online property website yet never had the option of direct contact or support from that company and instead dealt exclusively with the landlords who had simply used that website to advertise their property and discouraged us from contacting them.\\r\\nLogistically, it is quite an anti-social property as there are no shared communal areas and flats are far apart so we never really met or socialised with the other residents and it was pretty lonely. No parking was available so moving in and out was a bit of a nightmare, relying on carrying items from random car park spaces in the nearest local park. Since then we have had much more comfortable experiences dealing with professional estate agents and would always recommend that you go for those instead of these landlords who are not professional and have unreasonable expectations on tenants.\\r\\nFurniture generally was not in good condition and was either strangely pieced together or unusable for the bed, some tables and chairs which were sticky. The flies were a huge problem, flying in and out of the flat in swarms and whilst this was not exclusively the fault of the landlords as they seemed to fly in and out as they pleased if the windows were open (which they had to be as the flat got very hot at all times of year) some warning/assistance would have helped as bug bites were all too frequent. The lighting was naturally pretty dim when you were far away from the windows. The oven was not in a nice condition to start with (untreatably dirty) and the bathroom lacking in wallpaper/mould prevention on the walls/ceiling/bath/other surfaces.\\r\\nThey also somehow did not seem to know how the electricity worked (there is no gas) so we had to find that out all by ourselves and were without electricity for a few days while we had to contact and liaise with the electricity company. There are definitely many better options at much cheaper prices. The advertised rent was actually less than we had to pay in reality as the landlords advertised rent was every 28 days without bills so actual monthly costs (every 30/31 days) were considerably higher. We would absolutely recommend people look elsewhere at professional estate agents\\\\' properties. Also, general advice: take photos of all furniture in your rented property wherever you go when you move in so you can use those as evidence to them if needed (this would have made getting our deposit back slightly easier/possible when they accused us of leaving the apartment in a decrepid state which was frankly ridiculous as we cleaned it to a considerably better state than we found it in and a very reasonable state to the same standard as professional cleaners).\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'I had a very bad experience as a tenant at this property, which was a managed letting (via Douglas & Simmons, Wantage). It should be noted that the property is quite old, dating back to the 17th century.\\n\\r\\nThe owners, at the time of my letting, with the help of the letting agency, disputed my deposit (of five weeks rent), made false and grossly inaccurate claims to the Deposit Protection Scheme (DPS), including unofficial claims not listed in their offiical submission to the DPS. In fact, the total of the owners\\\\\\' claims on the deposit exceeded the deposit by about £30. The DPS, after considering the matter for almost 6 weeks, rejected their claims, and noted that it was their obligation to prove their claims, and not the tenant\\\\\\'s to disprove theirs, and that the owners had not proved their claims. The DPS also rebuked the owners and the letting agency for including unofficial claims on the deposit.\\n\\r\\nThe main claim by the owner related to damage to the plaster on the living room ceiling caused by water leaking from a standing bath upstairs. This happened within months of moving in, and was immediately reported by me to the letting agents. The letting agency did nothing for five months, and then sent a local contractor who was also unable to do anything. Clearly, there was a pre-existing defect in the bath, or the tiling, that allowed water to leak through the ceiling. It was not fit for purpose, and the owners should have realised this, before letting the property. \\n\\r\\nThe unofficial claims on the deposit included spurious claims for \\\\\"gardening costs\\\\\", despite being presented with very recent invoices for garden trimming jobs by a local private contractor, and also a charge to re-attach the owner\\\\\\'s dishwasher in place of my washing machine, something which I have never been asked to do in any previous letting.\\n\\r\\nThe owners were ultimately responsible for responding to maintenance issues, but this was generally quite unsatisfactory.\\n\\r\\nThe property may have changed hands, but if you are a tenant here, be aware of the bath, the garden, and the fact that house is more than three centuries old.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'We had a few issues with this property. The most prolific would have been the heavy mould issue in the bathroom ceiling and on several walls including the kitchen. There were some major plumbing issues and regular blockage of the drains. Eventually after much persistence we had a wall repaired and the house was painted, some furniture was also replaced. Whilst I would say that the agents were always polite, they were a bit slow to respond to the requests, often the excuse being they did not receive the email or could not recall meeting with us. The property is in a good location as a commuter to the city you would benefit a lot from the tube station within walking distance. Our bedroom was on the first floor and whilst the street are relatively quiet, there were a few occasions where people would stand outside and converse quite loudly. I spotted a few mice at the property but their sightings usually coincided with blocked drains and heavy rains. The garden is relatively low maintenance as it is paved but there is an issue with mouldy growths from excessive moisture in parts. The property is dark inside, on the ground floor you need the lights on in the day. There is a reception room on the ground floor which was used as a bedroom but the house is clearly a 3 bed with all the bedrooms on the first floor. As a multiple let for strangers, it is over crowded as there is only one small bathroom. As a let for a family, its a good size. The kitchen and bathroom needs serious attention. The walls have cracks and moisture. The single  bedroom upstairs is almost uninhabitable as it is freezing, and mould ridden. We cleaned it and repainted twice out of our own pockets. The guttering needs attention as it is allowing moisture to go into the walls. Damp re-proofing much needed. The inner staircase is broken and has been repaired by us, but not officially by a builder from the agency (the issue was brought up but not attended to).  If the owner of the property was interested in investing some money into a total upgrade not only to make it cosmetically beautiful but also safer and warmer, this would be an ideal property to rent. We moved out as we felt it was not safe to raise a child in at the current state.',\n",

Police would constantly turn up upstairs and no just one or two officers it was multiple (sounded like drug raids). On one occasion someone that lives on floor 2 or 3 chucked two bin bags into our front garden which forced myself to pick up dirty nappies, cat litter with cat poo in all with my bare hands and these bin bags were extremely full. Constant noise outside as very close to the clubs no matter if the day was a monday or saturday, if you live on the side of the road which 3 of the bedrooms do you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to be woken up, most likely from a couple aruging or fist fight. The price of the rent is roughly the same price as most halls of residence so if you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a student looking to rent here might as well just go to a halls of residence and be more secure and comfortable. The boiler did break a couple times and the landlords did act very quick on it which was good.\",\n",

Landlords are privately managing which makes repair issues sometimes awkward and landlord seeks to save money rather than find the best solution the first time. Unfortunate leak issue has been unable to be resolved during our tenancy as it turned out to be much bigger repair so we are vacating early and amicably. Landlords have been cordial during this process but at other times very difficult to deal with, plus they don\\\\'t live in the country and can be difficult to contact. For that reason I would likely not recommend this property unless they have someone managing it. Otherwise its a lovely house and good neighbourhood.\",\n",

I started living there in Mar 2013 and at the start of my tenancy, one of the rooms\\\\' heater was not working, which was reported to the landlord and I left the property in Mar 2015 and the heater still did not work. The landlord is an extremely rude, unprofessional person and he wouldn\\\\'t want to fix anything in the property, wouldn\\\\'t want to spend any money on anything. I even had to report to the council for the heating problem in one of the rooms. Even after that, he took months before he sent me a portable heater. The property has E7 night supply for water heater, which stopped working and he never got it fixed. I had to literally use the day time heater to survive. He can literally give you nightmares so choose wisely.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The property itself was nice and newly painted but the landlord was impossible to contact when we noticed critical problems. It took weeks and sometimes months to get any essential repairs done. Most of the issues were from before we moved in but were not noticeable during the viewings. We had no electricity in the back bedroom and kitchen for a few weeks after moving in and had to try calling him for weeks to get it fixed. We were told by the electrician who finally came that it was a patched electrical job and should never have been rented in such a condition. \\n\\r\\nWater from the gutters came gushing into the kitchen through the boiler exhaust pipe and flooded the kitchen. We had to wait a few weeks to get the roofers in to fix the gutters and block the hole. Also there was a huge safety risk with the windows. Located at the front of the property, they could not be locked and the main large window could be pushed from the outside in so anyone could come in and leave the property easily with large items. We were not made aware of this and when we noticed it it took weeks to get permission to secure them which we did at our expense and never got reimbursed. They had to be secured in such a way that we could not open them for the rest of the year of our tenancy. \\n\\r\\nThe toilet seat broke and it took a year to get it replaced. It was an unusual shape so I couldn\\\\'t just source it myself so we had a broken seat for nearly a year which I had to tape up and secure to the toilet bowl so we wouldn\\\\'t fall. Due to the flat being on the ground floor, we had to keep on top of the mould problem by cleaning the walls behind furniture and using a dehumidifier every day. The numerous workmen who had to come to our flat were all shocked it had been rented out with such important underlying problems. \\n\\r\\nTo top it off the landlord wanted to increase the rent by 11% if we renewed our contract for the next year without addressing the unfinished issues. We moved into a new flat and have never been happier.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The carpets had in grained dirt in them when I moved in which was impossible to extract without paying for a professional cleaner. Also the bathroom carpet smelt of urine when I moved in. A chronic water leak from a mains pipe over many years had meant there was a damp stain on the ceiling below my flat in the entrance hall, and there was an all pervasive smell of rotting damp floorboards. On warm days the carpet in the hall stank due to other tenants smoking whilst standing in the doorway and the smoke wafting through the open door into the building. The windows were badly maintained and on was nearly coming off its runners and falling out. The police visited the flat below me in my first month of tenancy and there was little or no sound insulation between each flat or the outside, making road noise and issue and tenants stereo systems and TVS, sometimes as late as 3 am. I didn\\\\'t have one night\\\\'s undisturbed sleep the two months I put up with living here, but despite repeated attempts to have the lease agreement annulled I was forced to pay a year\\\\'s rent (although the final six months the landlady did reduce the rent by one half, and I did get my deposit back.) overall rating for this rental experience: 2/10\",\n",

I had to cancel our moving in day and they promised they were finishing in a couple of days, they just ignored it until my partner said it was enough and they had broken the contract, then they finished it but closed the mains so we had no water. I called and called them to ask where the mains were and they just told me to pay somebody to know it. And then the problems started.... They didn\\\\'t fix anything, they knocked in the door and entered unannounced whenever they felt they wanted something until one day I said they couldn\\\\'t enter, and she entered and I had to call the police and when she saw me speaking on the phone with the police she ran away. After that I decided we had enough and we left. During the checkout I took pictures of the report, the guy that did the report didn\\\\'t find faults but then the landlord/agency sent a different report where they were charging the a lot of invented stuff and they wanted to keep the deposit so I sent them a letter and reminded that was not the actual report and I was demanding then. Next day they gave the deposit back. Talking with the neighbours about the problems we were having they said that previous tenants also had a lot of problems and they were evicted. I don\\\\'t want to see them again! Awful people.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The light fitting in our bathroom, an internal room with no windows, broke very early into our tenancy, and was not fixed for over a month. We had to use torches to use the bathroom. This should have been a warning to us for the issues we would have with maintenance. The property is managed through a local estate agent branch. We ended up having to get in contact with the head office and leave several complaints in order to get any maintenance work done. The staff at the local office were rude and completely incompetent through the whole process.. We were not given any details about our landlord and had to get his sister’s number (they both rent out flats in the building) from our neighbour in order to try and sort the maintenance issues. We also had the heating element in our oven break, which again took far longer to fix than it should have. We were told our tenancy would be continued after the initial six months, they said they were waiting for the landlord to sign the paperwork. He instead sent a staff member from the estate agents late one evening to serve us our notice and refused to give a reason as to why. When we moved out, we made sure to clean the entire property thoroughly. If anything it was in a better condition than when we moved in, but we made the error of not taking photographic evidence. The landlord refused to give us back our full deposit, stating that the flat required “professional cleaning”, which was completely untrue and unfair. We were always good tenants, we paid our rent on time, looked after the flat and didn’t cause any problems. We would not recommend this property to anyone, and will never rent through this estate agents again, and would encourage people to stay away from them (they still rent out this property now).',\n",

Moreover, the latter room has an entrance door directly onto the street and you can hear the noise from the traffic day and night.. you don\\\\'t feel safe either. The whole basement flat has in total two windows on the lower ground floor and two smaller windows in the other room on the ground floor, hence it\\\\'s dark and depressing most of the time and there is a huge problem with humidity and condensation. There are no windows in the two bathrooms neither in kitchen and one bedroom, which is really a storage room. The flat was flooded during our tenancy and the damage was so severe that we had to move out and terminate our tenancy. The landlady was difficult to reach when we had problems and never fixed them, despite taking the money from the deposit paid. Overall a very bad experience and I wouldn\\\\'t recommend this dwelling to anyone else. For the same money or less we found a better apartment in the same area.\",\n",

No other room was affected. We told the Estate Agents numerous times, and were told it was \\\\\"condensation, remember to have your heating on and open the windows regularly.\\\\\" Despite knowing how to keep a house, and following their \\\\\"instructions\\\\\", this room was still disgusting. I cleaned it with mould remover, and even ordered in hospital-grade cleaner, which did nothing. Within days the mould was back and worse than ever.\\n\\r\\nSecondly, every window in this three bedroom flat leaked. The master bedroom window leaked so bad, there were pools of water on the sill after every rain. The other windows in the house would seep in water, too.\\n\\r\\nThirdly, the electrics were an utter shambles. Plug sockets were hanging off the walls, half of them didn\\\\\\'t work, and there was cabling running next to the bath and toilet waste pipes.\\r\\nWhere they had installed mains wired fire alarms, they had moved the light fitting and left a hole with dangling wires.\\n\\r\\nDespite informing the Estate Agents if these issues, nothing was ever done. We eventually had to move as I got so ill with the mould, I had to be put on steroids for the damage it had done to my lungs.\\n\\r\\nI would NOT recommend Lomond Estate Agents for letting.',\n",

Although the people seem very friendly and polite, it was impossible to get them to fix simple things, like a broken dishwasher basket or a leaky tap. \\n\\r\\nThe flat does not have a stand-alone shower. You will have to sit in a bath tub and wash yourself to avoid water being all over the bathroom floor. The landlord refused to even consider installing a glass screen saying it’s too expensive.\\n\\r\\nThe flat gets VERY hot in the summer. Like +36C hot all day. Very difficult to sleep at night, let alone be in the flat during the day. Opening all windows does not help much. \\n\\r\\nAlso, the flat is advertised as a two bedroom, whereas in reality the second room cannot be classified as a bedroom - tiny non-opening windows and no heating.\\n\\r\\nAvoid.

       "  'comment_body': \"We are a young family with two kids and lived in this property for almost three years and have a lot of fond memories, less to do with the house itself, but more to do with the togetherness of our young family. \\n\\r\\nBut unfortunately that is where the good bit ends. I think the house itself needs major renovation. There are two receptions which are very small and not appropriate for a young bustling family. We had difficulty inviting anybody over as there was barely any space for an extra person or two sit down in the small reception. The property itself had not been extended at the rear unlike pretty much every property on the street, making the living area extremely cramped. This is particularly relevant given the high market equivalent rents we were paying (we would have paid similar or lower rents for extended, renovated properties). The carpets are very worn and clearly need replacing. The only reason we moved in the first place was because of an emergency situation involving another property, where we risked being stranded as a young family, so we took the first property that we could move in at the earliest. Our younger child was born after we moved in and this made it difficult for us to move out immediately.\\n\\r\\nFurther, we had a very difficult experience dealing with both the landlord as well as estate agents. The landlord was described by the agent himself as being \\\\'pernickety\\\\' and that I think describes the behavior best. Minor issues were raised towards the end of our tenancy for which we were charged anywhere from 5-200 pounds. We got the strong feeling of being taken advantage of and a guise of renovating several things in the house which are bound to be impacted by wear and tear (Especially with a family with two young kids). It needs to remembered that we had lived in this house for three years, never had any delayed rents, never haggled about anything much. I think, in all fairness, we were very good tenants and behaved how we would like to be treated if we were on the other side. \\n\\r\\nI think landlords should appreciate the difference between intentional damage to the property vs accidental damage vs wear and tear that is natural over time. The first two should be repaired by tenants, the last should be resolved amicably. Many of the complaints against us fit the last description and I knew if I raised this to arbitration, it would be resolved in our favour. Further, I think landlords like this one need to recognise the common sense logic of renting to trustworthy people who will take care of their property and look at the bigger picture. Its a small world and in today\\\\'s connected world, getting a bad reputation wont help.\",\n",

The room was north-facing, so didn\\\\'t get a lot of light, but meant that it was away from the noise of the street. Building work on the restaurant next door, however, went on for months starting at roughly 7.30 a.m. each morning. Bicycles could be stored in the halls although not explicitly allowed. Since the building is located in the center of Brighton, it was very convenient.

       "  'comment_body': 'Nice looking, clean good sized apartment overall. Really close to the town centre which is a huge plus.\\n\\r\\nOur property was managed by the estate agent Venture Properties who were overall very organised and helpful. When we moved in there was a leak under the sink for which they quickly arranged for a plumber to fix. They could have done more to pressure the plumber to fix the problem and chosen a more reliable company, as the one they chose took more than a week to come out leaving us without water for a week. \\n\\r\\nHouse was very clean on moving in and was easy to keep clean. Very efficient heating meant energy bills were low and the house heats up to room temperature naturally spring to autumn. North and east facing windows meant that we only got sun in the morning and this combined with a lack of any outdoor space made us feel cramped at times.\\n\\r\\nNoise: Next to a busy road but you can’t hear it when the windows are closed. Neighbour often plays music and TV so loud that you can hear every word but it wasn’t too often.',\n",

We moved after a revenge eviction from a property with the worst landlord ever, but have mostly been pleased with the service from Lettings Agents and landlords. The landlords live in South Africa, but did come to meet us and check the house for themselves on a visit, bringing some South African fudge! Very nice people. \\r\\nMost major problems are fixed promptly. We had a water leak out in the shed, which was fixed, a recent gas leak, and any issues are reported and fixed. The carpets were updated without having to ask, as they were getting very dated, and the walls were damproofed - the house is near a river, so there can be very minor mould that is usually kept in check by keeping the house clean and dry.\\n\\r\\nThe house could benefit from having a new kitchen and bathroom fitted, the cooker is very old.\\n\\r\\nIt also has a small garden - similar properties now have a higher rent and do not have a garden.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"We have had several problems with neigbourg and agent (Kay & Co) didn\\\\'t try to understand us. We just request a peaceful home but we had loud music on early morning (6 am) from our below neigbourg and also harmmer blows late in the night (1 am) from our above neighbour. We have some health problems related to insomnia and this issue was affecting us seriously. We have tried to get an agreement with the landlord to advance the fix term deadline and terminate early the tenancy agreement in a very good manner (offering as much flexibility as we can with the visits, keeping the house as clean as possible, giving 2 months notice, etc...) but they just said no.\\r\\nWe had not a valid check in report since they did a check in, we request to amend it, and we have never received an answer in this regard. Of course, nothing was signed by any party (landlord, agent or us). Let\\\\'s see if there is any issue when we request the deposit at the end of the tenancy (I will update the above score if needed). I must say that property is fully furnished so I think is even more important to have a valid check in from landlord side.\\r\\nAlso, we have asked for fixing some minor issues (blinds, switches, light bulbs...) at home when we start the tenancy agreement and has been passed 7 months and they are not still fixed. \\r\\nThe house is very good but I really not recommend it because the agency/landlord is care less with tenants. For the price you would pay here you can find better options.\",\n",

The letting agent (Ludlow Thompson) were useless, letting the landlord get away with all of this and saying they dont actually have authority to do anything at all. ...so what\\\\'s the point of them. My advice would be if you want to buy this place get a full, impartial survey because the whole place needs ripping out. If you are considering renting check how long the landlord has been in charge of the property for. If its been since before 2020, AVOID.

       "  'comment_body': \"Landlords were overly interested and did not respect our right to peacefully enjoy the property. We\\\\'ve rented for several years and have never experienced it to this extent. The day we moved in, I found their cousin peeking through the blinds, I was a bit perplexed but introduced myself to her. A day later, we had an email from the landlord saying there were too many people living in the property and they were concerned we had too much stuff as \\\\'many neighbours\\\\' reported lots of boxes coming in and 4 men sitting in the living room. They were my partner and his brothers and only the people listed on the tenancy stayed there. \\n\\r\\nMould was reported several times, they did nothing and said we should get a dehumidifer. We did and emptied it several times a day, my baby developed asthma and it was awful. Electricity bills were huge too because we needed windows open to air it (and expensive to run the dehumidifer). It was really terrible and it\\\\'s a problem that plagues many of the flats there.\\n\\r\\nAny slight issue and the landlady would come round herself, plus regular inspections and also whenever she was local (they are based in Singapore a lot of the time but have neighbours upstairs). It was intrusive, but she was polite and friendly as was the landlord - to me.\\n\\r\\nWe\\\\'d agreed we\\\\'d all like to extend the tenancy. Unfortunately, one day the landlord came round when my partner was there too. He took one look at my black partner (I am white) and just would not look at him. He immediately made excuses to leave. Shortly after, the lettings agent called and asked if I\\\\'d like help to find somewhere to rent. I was confused as we\\\\'d already agreed the extension. Apparently, the landlord - upon meeting my black partner - had decided to issue a Section 21 and evict us. It was in the post and arrived the next day. They wouldn\\\\'t answer any contact and put the flat back on the market for the same price and advertised it to families just like us.\\n\\r\\nWhen we moved out, they tried to steal our deposit. They said we\\\\'d let mould build up and never mentioned it to them. Luckily we had proof of everything and had left the flat in a spotless condition and had photos to prove it, so we got our deposit back. But it took a very long time as we had to contest it through the appeals process.\\n\\r\\nAvoid at ALL costs. We also had bikes stolen, Christmas presents stolen and my identity stolen while we lived there. But most of the neighbours are absolutely lovely and so is the area.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'This property belongs to a company so it very hard to catch hold of landlord in case of issue. My experience with this property was worst ever and hence I am here to write the review. The deposit I paid to landlord was never put in deposit protection scheme and I got to know this after moving out of the property. To not get into legal matters I kept chasing landlord but the the landlord has a harsh verbal communication. Although I received my deposit back after 1 year of moving out this property the landlord used money for 2 year during my tenancy and a year after that. Finally gave an option to pay deposit in installments which the landlord was not able to pay this in due time. My final settlement was deducted amount of £210, reason given was I didnt submit the professional cleaning receipt. I would not recommend this property as the landlord is not professional and without fear illegally holds the deposit. If you are reading this review always see that your deposit is protected and the landlord behaves as if the agreement is to abide my only tenant and landlord can so anything they want.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The house itself is ok - Victorian terraced house with character. Somewhat tatty and not been refurbished for a long time with old, stained carpets and curtains, cracked paint etc. The more important issues with this property stem from the landlady (Deborah Turner) and the way in which the property was managed. The landlady lives overseas and wants little to do with the property - she appeared for a couple of hours on check in and check out. Serious issues such as a faulty gas fireplace (unsafe) were either not fixed satisfactorily, took huge amounts of correspondence and pushing or were not fixed.\\n\\r\\nThe major issue here though is the financial management. We were able to meet the previous tenants in order to give them some mail that had arrived, they had moved locally. They said we should be very careful with the deposit when checking out, we listened but were not sure exactly what the problem was. They did say they were having to fight to get their deposit back. When we left at the end of the tenancy having looked after the property well and left it in better condition than when when we moved in, we then understood what the previous tenants meant.\\n\\r\\nThe landlady did an inspection (before we moved out but when we were not there so could not comment on her observations) and sent a list of issues she wanted to keep money for. This was for most of the £4,500 deposit. We were shocked! We replied with detailed answers to her points however she just did not respond to what she said and continued to press for money. Fortunately we had taken photographs of all issues/marks in the house the day after we moved in - these had been emailed to the landlady at the time, and also when she raised issues upon checkout. We provide detailed explanations on each problem she wanted us to pay for, sent copies of emails with her from during he tenancy, and resent t photographs. However when repkying she chose to ignore our explanations and not respond the points made, to ignore th  photographic evidence and ignore the copies of email correspondence! For example, she wanted money for a wooden island top to be resanded - we even had a photo of the poor condition it was in when we moved in. Landlady said it had been newly sanded and varnished before we moved in - nonsense. She wanted us to pay for an aerial on the roof to be repaired - we had not even had terrestrial TV. Many other items also. It became clear she was just out to get as much money from our deposit as possible and not to consider the evidence supplied. This was very frustrating. Her communication became aggressive and inappropriately unprofessional.\\n\\r\\nThis had to go through the dispute process with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme - we raised a case. It takes a lot of time to be thorough in contesting the landlady\\\\'s dishonesty point by point but the photos and email evidence we had kept every time we communicated with her meant the outcome was we were asked to pay less than £200 from the deposit instead of the £4,000 she wanted. Fortunately the TDS is there to stop dishonest landlords from stealing from tenants and we were protected as a result. I would strongly recommend not renting this property as it seems the landlady tries it on at the end of all tenancies to steal money from tenants\\\\' deposits as they leave (as evidenced by the tenants before us, and us). It\\\\'s sad people like this are still allowed to rent out properties and try to take advantage of people. Fortunately we were prepared so she didn\\\\'t get away with it. Avoid. There are better properties for similar money in the area with far more honest landlords who act with integrity. I hope renters see this and avoid the frustration we went through, at least she didn\\\\'t get away with it in the end.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"This property requires a significant level of refurbishment. Furnishings and quality of fixtures and fittings are basic to say the least. One of the main issues is that the property has numerous holes, gaps and crevices in walls, floors and ceilings meaning we had numerous infestations during our tenancy. I actually struggle to think of a species that didn\\\\'t waltz in to the property like it was an animal refuge - squirrels, mice, flies, maggots - you name it. On top of this, the landlord (jennEy Turner) wasn\\\\'t very responsive in fixing any issues or reported breaches by these critters. Another incident involved a plumbing leak in the upstairs en suite, which brought down the ceiling to a lower floor bedroom. The plumber explained that the piping was very poor quality and needed to be replaced with better quality materials or it would simply happen again. Guess what? The same piping was selected by the landlord. Time bomb. When it came to the end of the tenancy, the landlord was extremely unfair with deposit deductions and tried to sting us for additional works that had nothing to do with the way we looked after the property. Negotiations went on for months and the landlord was very aggressive, threatening legal action and ultimately trying to prey on the naivety of tenants. We managed to negotiate back some of the cost but still lost out in the end - desperate just to bring an end to this terrible experience. I don\\\\'t think the landlord has much experience at all.\",\n",

The property is set up as a \\\\\"make do\\\\\" condition, everything has been unprofessionally repaired, the washing machine kept breaking down which left us without anything to clean our clothes for a week every time. In the end, the landlord bought another second hand washing machine. All the furniture in the property was found from outside, including the beds and mattresses. \\n\\r\\nAll in all I would not recommend this property to anyone.

       "  'comment_body': 'The landlord was very slow to respond to any issues and in the main did not make any remedial work. For example broken drawers, broken slats under the bed, windows painted shut (fire hazard) were never fixed and therefore  we had to resolve these ourselves. \\r\\nDamp and peeling paint in the bathroom  was not dealt with till a year after we reported it and only when we had given notice that we were leaving. Boiler broke and needed replacing, the landlord did not give the go ahead for it to be replaced for a month after receiving the quotes and only when we were in our last two weeks of being in the flat.\\r\\nAlso the furniture in the flat was old or broken, eg sofa , living room rug, vacuum cleaner, kitchen bin. The sofa was very uncomfortable and the land lord would not replace it or allow us to. The rug was quite worn and again the landlord would not replace it or allow us to. The bin and the vacuum were broken and we were not allowed to dispose of them as the landlord wants to keep them for the next tenant.\\r\\nThe neighbours were nice but could be noisy, they occasionally had friends over in the garden till early hours in the morning and because the bedroom backs on to the garden and was not double glazed the noise when it happened was very intrusive.\\r\\nThere is a very popular pub across the road from the flat and when not in COVID times was open till early hours in the morning on the weekend and therefore noise was quite loud at the front of the flat. However the pub did try hard  in trying to keep people quiet and move them on when they left the pub.\\r\\nThe flat is in a great location and had some nice features, the kitchen was okay and there is a lot of storage space and the garden is very big and spacious if quite shade, but for the amount of money we paid I would have expected the landlord to be slightly attentive.',\n",

Now they want to claim for a bit of paint chipped off from the window sill and we are still waiting to know how much money they want to take from our deposit.

       "  'comment_body': 'We lived in the property for 15 months. During this period we noticed:\\n\\r\\n1) noise from upstairs and common entrance: it is possible to hear everyone going in and out of the property clearly. The hallway door doesn’t close gently so all tenants have to push it to close which you can hear loud and clear from both bedrooms. Also above the main bedroom is the first floor living room and kitchen so whenever you go to bed you can still hear the neighbor above you walking, watching tv and cooking. You can also hear people going up and down the hallway stairs clearly from any of the bedrooms.\\n\\r\\n2) pigeons: the pateo on the second bedroom was inaccessible for 4 months. Pigeons nested in the property and were using the pateo and the pipes to poop. Spikes were installed and no poop has been found since.\\n\\r\\n3) Mice: two different surveyors attested the property has mice access points in the kitchen. The issue was reported on May 29th 2020 and hasn’t been fixed yet . I am writing this on June 28th 2020.\\n\\r\\n4) Rat in the front garden: rubbish bins do not have lids and the front garden was maintained once in 15 months . The rubbish accumulation created the perfect environment for rat, which has been seen twice between May 29th 2020 and June 28th 2020.',\n",

After the treatment I moved it all bk to the flat and set up the bunkbeds.\\r\\n20 min before bedtime I turned on light in bedroom and found 8 adult bed bugs on one wall alone which made it clear no treatment had been done at all agency were unhelpful all they said was they will phone up maintenance.\\r\\nI\\\\'m disgusted that they have knowingly re rented an infested property to a new tenant and allowed them to have children there to be eaten alive while they sleep!\\r\\nThey have lied about doin treatment now for the 3rd time and I\\\\'m considering what i can do to get the legal obligations enforced.....ahhhh\",\n",

If you move in you will need to provide your own blinds, the ones from the landlord in the bedrooms are paper thin, you will wake up at dawn and he refuses to replace them.  When we moved in there was a prepayment meter we were not informed of, the landlord misled us to say Southwark Council don\\\\'t allow them to be changed (I called the council up and confirmed this was incorrect).  The property managers are not helpful, at the end of our tenancy they ignored our requests (emails and phone calls) for the check out report for a month.\\r\\nOverall it is a nice flat but given its location, exterior, other flats available for a similar price and lack of outdoor space it is overpriced.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Property:\\r\\nThe property is a beautiful period property with high ceilings and large bay windows. My flat was the perfect size for me as a student/young professional, a large kitchen-lounge, a decent sized bedroom and bathroom. Furniture was provided by the landlord and was good quality. In the winter the property was quite cold probably due to it being an old building, the flat had electric heating which meant in the coldest months was a bit expensive to heat the flat.\\r\\nLandlords: Virginia and David Gatherer\\r\\nVirginia and David were the best landlords I\\\\'ve ever had. The move in process was very smooth and the flat was perfectly clean, Virginia even offers help with setting up your bills which was very helpful for me as this was my first time renting after living in student halls. I saw them both on a regular basis as they owned a lot of properties in the street so were around a lot doing odd jobs. They were fantastic with any repairs that needed doing, getting them done quickly and were also very helpful by being there when any workmen/plumbers etc were coming and I couldn\\\\'t be in due to being at work. Every week David would put the communal bins out for collection so none of the tenants had to worry about this. The property had high ceilings so they even changed the lightbulbs for me when needed. Virginia\\\\'s communication with us was fantastic, always informing us if there were to be any workmen around the properties, if she would be showing people around etc. Overall Virginia and David were great landlords, as someone that moved to Sunderland from out of the area on my own I felt very lucky to have them as my landlords and felt I could ask them for any assistance I needed.\\r\\nArea:\\r\\nor me the property was the perfect location. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the University of Sunderland city campus which is where I was based as a student. It also less than 15 minutes walk from Sunderland Hospital which was perfect for me as this where I worked during and after my degree. There is a metro station at the end of the street, less than 2 minutes walk, providing easy access to Newcastle. The city centre is about 15 minutes walk away. There is an aldi about 20 minutes walk away, a morrisons petrol station around the corner and also a small corner shop less than a minute away. As a student or young professional working in the city centre this would be the perfect location for you to live. The property is quite close to a main road which could be slightly noisy at busy times.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"1. Kitchen sink block. It will remain an issue forward though we as tenants, hired an engineer to fix it three times along. I did so because landlord responses slower than she should and sent nasty, rude, unprofessional men to fix it poorly. And landlord has not paid back to me yet. More importantly, it will still be an issue as the kitchen pipe was set up in a wrong way, so that new drainage will keep blocking the sink, according to expert advice I seek, unless landlord will pay to re-install the sink pipe properly, which is highly unlikely as I observe. \\n\\r\\n2. Condensation or mould issues. The main bedroom has a gas pipe built INSIDE it, again in a wrong and stupid way. Water condensates on the pipe and no carbon monoxide indicator is installed. The main bedroom is thus very damp in winter. This is against the law severely. The bath room is slightly better but the fan is too weak to help. We had to open windows each time after showering in whatever weather. \\n\\r\\n3. The carpets in two rooms are quite old and it takes a lot of efforts to clean them. \\n\\r\\n3. Mice were found in 2015 winter. Though we purchased poison to kill them, mice feces are still identified in the kitchen as recent as Dec/2016. \\n\\r\\n4. Induction process by landlord and estate agent. It was done poorly or more precisely, it was not done at all. Agent leaded me into the flat and when I challenged him that it was not properly cleaned, he boldly said I need to clean it myself. Landlady did not appear at all on the first I moved in, and snobbishly left an inventory without any photo taken. Also the inventory contained wrong readings of meters. Be careful about that! \\n\\r\\n5. Landlord/Managing agents. A simple word for Landlord and Landlady: horrible. They are ignorant, and rude. But landlady carries an additional feature: smarmy. As to agents, I met several of them. They are generally sneaky, coward. I say so because they appear harsh but become soft when I challenge them with the law. \\n\\r\\n6. Deposit refund. Landlady claims to charge me for \\\\'professional cleaning\\\\', though the flat was not professionally cleaned when I moved in. I am still working to request for my deposit back. \\n\\r\\n7. Therefore stay away from this property and its landlord/landlady including its agent Foxton.\",\n",

His property is still up for let now as he can not seem to keep people there as he is charging so much rent and he has had to now drop it back down. \\r\\nIt makes me angry that landlords can just get you to leave for their own greed. \\r\\nHe would often ask for rent to be paid in cash and he would also use the house for his own storage (shed and loft) which was very inconvenient.\",\n",

Great location in town.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe walls are fairly dented/scratched, you can tell there hasn\\\\'t been any redecorating in a fairly long time.  There\\\\'s especially a huge hole in one door . (a couple inches tall) which they were asked to but never did fix.\\n\\r\\nYou can hear upstairs talking and their footsteps, but not any of the other neighbours.  No-one played loud music whilst we were there.  The bedroom side is quiet, although my partner could hear when busses go past (I couldn\\\\'t).  You can hear a small amount of general road noise from the lounge side.\\n\\r\\nThere is a large building opposite the road (lounge side) which is due for demolition - it\\\\'s been waiting to come down for 8 months, unsure when that will start.\\n\\r\\nThe heating is very old night storage, and is not really worth using.  It heats up with cheaper electricity overnight, and then slowly releases heat throughout the day.  Heating has a mode designed to release heat slower early in the day so you still have heating in the evening, but during winter most of the heat dissapates by mid-afternoon despite this (they are very old units).  Turning up the heating to full input does get the winter temperature above 16 for most of the day, so it\\\\'s not illegal, but was impractically expensive to run.  Was without heating for a month waiting for the landlord/agency to fix.  1 week of this was fair as plumbers were waiting for parts, but the other 3 weeks was the landlord/letting agency being slow.\\n\\r\\nNo pets were allowed, no photos were allowed to be hung.   Several requests for minor repairs (a loose/wobbly tap, a hole in a door etc..) were ignored.  Charged £60 for end of tenancy cleaning despite in our opinion it being cleaner than we received the flat.  Talk lots of your own photos when you move in.\\n\\r\\nWas told on viewing (not in contract) that there are communal cupboards in the hallway, but this was untrue (well they\\\\'re communal, but not for flat 3).\\n\\r\\nDangerously close to Waitrose.  The honeyborne cycle path runs behind the house and is great for running/walking.\\n\\r\\nLovely location, right by town.  It was a nice place to be especially in the summer.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Couldn\\\\'t have asked for a nicer landlord or property.  The flat is bright during the day and cosy at night.  The one issue was when the boiler broke but considering that the property was purchased 3 weeks before I moved in there was no way the landlord could have done anything to prevent it breaking and in the event did everything humanly possible to get it fixed quickly.  Compared to other properties in the area the rent is incredibly reasonable; anything else at this price is either the size of a shoebox or has a really odd layout.  The area is also really nice.  I\\\\'m sorry to be leaving (moving overseas).\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"This is a lovely little flat which is really well located for Honor Oak, Forest Hill, and the surrounding area. For the rent and the studio flat description you get a good amount of space for one person and in the end my partner moved in as well which just about worked! The private woodland behind is a great addition to the property as well. The main two issues were the damp - when we left we found the back of the sofa to be covered with mould and the bathroom was incredibly damp and needed a dehumidifier running it in constantly. I know this is often a problem with basement flats but after we moved out the landlady appeared to be painting over the mould with damp proofing where as what it really needed was better ventilation. The other issue was the boiler, which may well have been updated by now, but it was faulty and even a professional plumber who came round to check it couldn\\\\'t get it to run at any less than 100% so to avoid baking alive in there we had to switch it off for most of the time. This affected my gas bill, which took a rather long time to pay off. Other plumbing issues were quickly sorted though and overall the landlady was a great person to deal with.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"While the property has been recently renovated and looks very good (the bathroom was the selling point but later became the problem child) We slowly realized whoever green-lit the renovation exchanged functionality and quality for aesthetic. On our first day on the property, I noticed a severe mold/ damp issue, rat or rodent droppings, and missing pieces around the house. None of these issues were made known to us before we decided to rent. I reported said issues the same day, no reply from our property managers. The rodent infestation was the worst. Rats would chew their way through floors and walls, (I don\\\\'t know if it was the previous tenant or the landlord that decided the best way to combat the problem was to stuff tin foil in the holes.) and leave urine and droppings in the kitchen, we could hear them in the walls. We got nowhere with our estate agents and in the end had to call our own pest control and pay out of pocket, for our first week in the house! Over the next 8 or so weeks, we emailed and called relentlessly about our serious mold issue in my bedroom! It got to a point I had to sleep in the living room as my breathing was getting poor, nausea, headaches, etc not to mention the silverfish and other insects that now infested my room due to the humid environment. In the end, I could no longer wait for our estate agents and had to clean it myself. The room was so damp the paint peeled off all the way down to plaster, on 2 of my walls. I found 3 large black mold clusters, from which more mold and dampness were spreading. I took 2 months of our own work and money just to make the property livable. The dampness and mold is still an ongoing problem. Are estate agents no help at all. They have terrible communication, and customer service, and honestly lost all my trust that they can help us with any of our problems. For example, the plumbing in our bathroom is shot to hell and creates a recurring blockage, and leaks from our toilet. The longer we spend time in the house the more issue we discover. This house is held together by ducktape and paper. I would not be surprised if they used ramen noodles to fix holes in the walls. Overall this house is old, humid, and moldy, with poor ventilation, poor or no insulation, noise pollution from our next-door or upstairs neighbors, and a terrible experience with our estate agents.\",\n",

The landlord refused to give us back rent for those days, even though there is a law that states these issues must be fixed within 24 hours. Furthermore, it’s been 3 months since we’ve moved out and he is trying to charge us the majority of the security deposit for extra cleaning, lightbulbs and paint. We only lived there for 6 months.

Heating did not include combi-boiler facilities. Begged to have shower facilities and double glazing fitted, which then without warning made the bill hiked up beyond \\\\'affordable\\\\' maximum budget, especially for DSS tenants. Insulation is  appauling and damn was rife unless heating was switched on that caused so many problems with huge energy bills. No effort on the part of the letting agency was made to rectify problems in a timely or polite manner - it always was out of the hands of tenants, even problems with noise nuisance and lack of access to the back garden from upstairs. The whole building is a risk in a fire emergency and no real enforcement by the letting agency to make the property safer or nicer to live in unless the tenant pays extortionate rates for this or is willing to be kicked out at a moments notice for pointing out very basic maintainance issues. Even the electricity circuit breaker was not properly checked to ensure it could stand the small amounts of energy used on other circuits which had to be replaced later by an electrician.

       "  'comment_body': 'The house is nice although susceptible to mould/damp\\n\\r\\nThere was a serious electrical problem that would occur every couple of months, the fusebox caught fire on one occasion. Apparently this was due to some dodgy electrical work done in the past. The landlord never provided an electrical safety certificate. He was very reluctant to spend money solving this (or any other) problem. At the end of the tenancy he tried to extract huge amounts from the deposit and we had to fight very hard to get it back, even though he was asking for money to replace items that had not even been there at the start of the tenancy. He had refused to carry out inventories to save money. He would sometimes send unqualified family members to do repairs. A nice house otherwise but a very stingy landlord causing problems.',\n",

He never responds to communication regarding issues with the property.\\r\\nThe house is in need of decorating inside. \\r\\nI keep on top of the cleaning to reduce problems from condensation. There are issues with the gas boiler which is extremely old but seems to keep passing the landlords yearly checks. It is not energy efficienct and costs more than double what a newer boiler would cost to run. The landlord refuses to replace it. The Windows are alluminium framed and need replacing as a lot of heat is lost through gaps from not closing properly!\\r\\nThere is no carpet downstairs and upstairs carpet is not of good quality and has been down for over 14 years.

In the end our tenancy was terminated as the flat was completely unsafe and both the gas and electrics could at points have killed our baby. The electrics and gas are now being resolved but insist on seeing all safety certificates and seek details of the qualifications of the professional who issued them before moving in. We were given compensation from the landlady as our experience was so awful, this was reasonable and offered by her and paid very promptly. We don\\\\'t know all details but get the impression that there was a breakdown in relationship between her and the agents. Things could have really improved but do ask some searching questions before taking this property on.....oh and the guy downstairs is really nice but very loud at times, nothing anyone can do about that but good to know if you aren\\\\'t a heavy sleeper!\",\n",

More years I extended the stay, rent went higher and higher. It had to be the opposite!\\r\\n2. Landlord once arranged some furniture collection from the flat. Delivery guys waited 5 min because of door bell was broke, which Landlord didn\\\\'t fix and because of that wait Landlord asked us to pay, Unbelievable! \\r\\n3. I asked ahead, to stay in property for extra 2 weeks and it has been approved. At the last second Landlord asked me to pay 15% increase rent because of that! \\r\\n4. On top of everything, Landlord did repair work of pipes and heated during 3 weeks while we were stayed in and didn\\\\'t compensate a penny! \\n\\r\\nThere were many other examples like the above which I don\\\\'t remember at the moment. Overall experience was very stressful, Landlord even showed up in the flat randomly once and said it was time for the flat checkup early morning, threatening with his cousin lawyer in every other word. Landlord even stressed so much future tenant that, he(future tenant) came to the property at night and asked me if Landlord was adequate at all. It\\\\'s the shame Landlord seems very nice in the beginning when I met, seems it was just a mask.\\n\\r\\nSo hopefully this review will be future tenants to make the right decision.\",\n",

Also, you hear the neighbour upstairs all the time walking around and also children screaming - I always thought that they maybe forgot to put something into the ceiling because you heard everything they did. Also keep in mind that it is next to Northolt RAF Base - good thing if you are a aviation enthusiast. The boiler stopped working in the winter but the agency was very quick to sort this out. we were the first ones moving in after the building was newly built, hence there was no issue with anything. The check out left a sourer taste in my mouth because the agency was complaining about dust on the doors...\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Hi there,\\n\\r\\nI lived here for nearly two years. The broadband is impossibly slow and there is nothing you can do about it. Although the landlords are the daughter and son of the people who live in the same grounds, it is in fact the parents who act like landlords, constantly checking up on what you are doing, proper busy bodies. \\r\\nI asked if I could plant shrubs, they approved this, so I spent 300 pounds on plants for the garden, three months later they asked me to pull them all out as they thought they might poison the garden. \\r\\nThe worst if the electric gate right next to all the bedroom windows, it clatters open constantly as people drive down to the \\\\'big house\\\\' and make you constantly on edge. Also, the tenant is the one who pays for the electric on the gate as it is metered in the house. On top of this, at 5am EVERY morning including Sundays, the paper van comes through it, waking everyone up on the clock, to deliver the big house\\\\'s newspapers. \\r\\nWhen you are out in the garden there is no privacy, the landlords are constantly out there on their ride on mower, and it is just never peaceful or relaxing, even though it looks it from the outside. It looks really pretty but don\\\\'t be fooled. The road it is on becomes a motorway rat run at 6pm and BOTH my cats were run over, one is now brain damaged, the other has three legs. \\r\\nThe first year I lived there they left asbestos in the kitchen, I was absolutely livid as I asked them if it was asbestos so they sent their bog it builder man over who said it wasn\\\\'t. A year later it turns out that it was as I insisted on a professional re-check it as so many people had told me it looked like asbestos right over my cooker. \\r\\nGenerally, it was awful experience and really expensive for a crammed small 3 bedroom house with no storage and awful bathrooms. The landlords have completely skimped and left most of it as an 80s house and don\\\\'t care about their tenants staying long term, they are just greedy, and beware, the landlord neighbour is also an ex-judge and both the husband and wife are extremely condescending. Forget about ever getting fibre broadband. Even though it\\\\'s next to a housing estate in Bovey it is 2.5 miles from the exchange and on a copper wire and very very slow so no netflix and no gaming for your kids. A horrible place all in all even though it looks pretty from the outside. Don\\\\'t rent it, it will make you stressed, sleep deprived, your pets will be injured or killed, and you will feel constantly watched, not a home at all.\",\n",

There arte no gas services in the property, and the landlord supplies the electricity, and does not allow freestanding gas units or the like, making you beholden to his rates. The front of the property is dominated by the remains of the woodworking factory, and the front is always crowded with work vehicles and blocked walkways, with no way for emergency services if they were needed. The property is not insulated and has a chroinic damp problem, is impossible to heat. After assuring us it was quiet, they sent their men to start heavy renovations above the day after we moved in leading to months of torture.

We can hear any movement from upstairs at all times and the tenants downstairs complain to us about very normal things to do in the house, like talking or having TV on. They would knock on their ceiling at any time, including very early mornings, waking us up, for no reason. We don\\\\'t snore, we don\\\\'t party in the house, we don\\\\'t have blasting music on, we don\\\\'t watch loud TV and we don\\\\'t do anything at unreasonable times, therefore there is no explanation to the stressful time they\\\\'re making us go through. On top of them complaining to us, there\\\\'s also the fact that we can hear the upstairs tenants very loudly, we fall asleep with the sound of someone snoring in some other apartment, we can hear vibrating phones receiving messages throughout the night from other apartments. The road is fairly quiet. The only year-round noise we have to complain about is the house itself.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Belvoir Manchester North were shambolic to say the least. Within a month or two of moving in we reported a leak in the bath, which was dripping through electrical fittings in the floor below. This went unfixed for the duration of the tenancy. Similarly we had an issue with an en-suite shower that also leaked through electrical fittings to the floor below. Again going unfixed. We had a boiler leak on a weekend. They had no emergency contact number and instead requested emails to be used. As an ISP worker I can list numerous reasons why this is a terrible idea. The issues with leaks were only looked to be fixed after we’d finally had enough and given our notice, the letting agent manager played dumb in terms of us wanting to leave. He also asked for fees for references for the new property which were not advertised on their website or in their office l, breaking the ASAs ruling in tenancy fees. We have still yet to recieve any sign of us having our deposit back after two years. Shambolic doesn’t even begin to cover this company.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The flat had a very convenient price and overall it was nice. Awesome having two bathrooms, including one jacuzzi! However, the managing process by the landlord and repairs have been aweful, making my year there extremely stressful. First, they rented us the property with several problems to the bathroom (no tiling, a leak) that took six weeks to get fixed - without any rent reduction. Second, the people that our landlord sent us to repair problems, did not clean up after themselves and were often late, causing us organisational problems. The electricity had several issues: sometimes it totally stopped working as the circuit is old and got wet. There was mould in one of the rooms, as it had an open flat above. Therefore it is useful to use a dehumidifier. Furthermore, it took them a month to give us our deposit back, which is a very long time. Furthermore, the agency managing the property after we had our deposit back asked us to pay extra fees for cleaning, very dodgy!',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"This property is managed by Hobdays Estate Agency. They are extremely slow to respond to any issue and for the 3 years of our tenancy, we had to constantly chase them - including for issues regarding heating and hot water. They often behave in ways that are essentially unlawful, i.e. they did not fix heating and hot water issues within the timeframe stated by law. We did not have enough hot water for more than a year, due to their (and the landlady\\\\'s) refusal to replace a non working water tank. The boiler had to be on for 5 hours in order to heat up an extremely old water talk with capacity for two 10-minute showers. \\n\\r\\nWe did not have heating that worked at a good enough standard for two years. The boiler in the property is extremely inefficient due to its age, but the landlords refuse to replace it even though the gas engineer has recommended replacing it every year since 2019. In addition, the property is extremely poorly insulated, which results in a very cold house even with the heating on. \\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it took them 6 days to replace a broken fridge and an entire month to find a tree surgeon to reduce a long branch of a tree that literally only took 5 minutes in the end. Hobdays inspect the property a few times a year but do not tell you about this before signing the contract and do not give a reasonable window of time for when to expect them. They are very quick to follow up, though, if they need something from their tenants instead. \\n\\r\\nThe landlords of this property have also refused to fix issues like leaking taps, a barely working toilet flush, and very severe mould issues in various places in the property, due to very poor insulation. In fact, they asked us to paint over the mould on walls, and never took any responsibility for it despite us sending the agency photos of the walls and some of our belongings being covered in mould. We have, as a result of all this, suffered with cough and chilblains in the winter.  \\r\\nWhen we first moved in we had to ask them to replace door handles in certain rooms in order for the doors to close, as they expected people to live there without even having doors that close in the bedrooms, the main bathroom, and the cupboards.   \\n\\r\\nAt the end of the tenancy, Hobdays did not release our deposit within the 10-day limit as the law requires, did not give us any updates unless we chased them up persistently to get our money back, and did not take any steps to return our (full) deposit until we reminded them that withholding our deposit without a reason is unlawful. Several weeks later, they finally returned our deposit without even apologising for once again breaking the law and unnecessarily wasting our time.  \\n\\r\\nOverall, the landlords of this property and Hobdays are by far the worst we have ever had to deal with - unreliable, unempathic, irresponsible.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The property is owned by a local Church and they were only interested in getting their rent not in maintaining or investing any time or money in the property. The garage was broken into, I had to pay for the repairs to make it secure again. The washing machine broke several times and after 6 months of continual complaint we eventually got a new one. Same with the gas hob, took over a year to get new one, despite only two of four rings working. The boiler was supposedly serviced but came home to flooded kitchen and boiler wouldn\\\\'t light. Resolved ourselves using local boiler guy. Carpets were cheap nasty and never replaced, bought our own carpet cleaner in the end. The property had old single glazed windows and were lead glass in places. These were poorly maintained and falling apart and couldn\\\\'t really be opened. They also leaked heat and the house never properly heated up due to this. In the end when things broke in the house we fixed them and paid for repairs ourselves as waiting for repairs would have taken weeks to months. No good when boiler is broken. We also had a continual problem with slugs in the house as there were so many ways they could get in due to poor maintenance and fit of doors, skirting boards etc. The bathroom was often mouldy as the extractor fan rarely if ever worked. The toilet regularly leaked sewage and was repaired several times, but never well enough to stop the leak entirely. One of the final straws was rising damp in the floor level kitchen cupboards which ruined anything not in a tin. The Church property manager  came round once and basically patronized us with his attitude. When we complained he said the church is a charity and we said no you are our landlord and we expect that you deal with us as such. He was a pompous man. I can\\\\'t recommend renting this house after our experience. Also the letting agents were useless.\",\n",

But...\\r\\nI would not recommend this property for a number of reasons.\\r\\n- Huge insulation problems!\\r\\nThe main bedroom has no insulation at all so does not matter how long you keep the heating on, the moment when you turn it off the room starts to cool down rapidly. It is freezing cold at winter time.\\r\\nThe same with the bathroom.\\r\\nBut the biggest problem is the house has no water insulation!!! That means after every rainy day all the walls are soaking wet! After two weeks the paint came off the walls and the mould started to grow everywhere! We contacted the agency several times, but they did nothing about it! We had to use a dehumidifier and take it from room to room. It was going 24/7 to control humidity. That obviously cost us a lot of money to buy and run. No compensation whatsoever from the landlord!\\r\\nAnd if you think that was the worst, think again.\\r\\n- The worst thing we had to face there caused by the landlord himself when he decided that the easiest way to get rid of the dirty water in the kitchen is to connect the waste pipe into the rainwater highway just front of the house what is obviously illegal!! Yes, that is right! So all the tenants over the years polluted the water with everything what goes down in a kitchen sink without knowing it! \\r\\nWe just realised what is going on when it blocked completely. The agency sent someone who fixed it than they sent the bill to us to pay for it! We did not pay fortunately because after that it happened again every 3 month.  A manager from the water highways tried to sort the issue out with the landlord, but he was never available. It is still an ongoing problem. \\r\\nWhen it blocked last time, everybody refused to clean it out, so we could not use the whole kitchen area! No washing machine, no dishwasher, nothing. And the solution? The landlord idea was to move all the machines to the back! Into one of the bedrooms!! Hey? At this point we had enough.\\n\\r\\nAll in all it was a very bad experience with both the landlord and the agency. \\r\\nEvery time we reported something the agency was not able to reach the landlord therefore they never sorted any problem out. I had to do everything myself. I am glad it is over now! I just wish that the law would be more powerful against these type of agencies and landlords. These kind of properties should never be rented out to humans to live in them! :-(',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The flat itself was lovely and done to a high standard, however our experience with the landlord was just so difficult from start to finish.\\n\\r\\nTo begin with, my bathroom had a mould problem in my bathroom due to a lack of ventilation or fan which I reported to the landlord in October 2019. It took months to be resolved, and I had to eventually threaten council intervention if this wasn\\\\'t fixed. Eventually, in late February 2020 - nearly 5 months later - I was given a dehumidifier after the landlord claimed (wrongly) that they hadn\\\\'t been made aware of the problem (she had been - five times in writing via email and WhatsApp). This was especially distressing since I have breathing issues, which were exacerbated by this problem, and I was essentially blamed for letting the problem get \\\\'out of control\\\\' by the landlord instead of simply being apologised to for having to put up with it for so long. There was no adequate ventilation, which is in direct contravention to the Housing Act.\\n\\r\\nInsult duly added to injury, the landlord then turfed my housemates and me out of the property in the midst of a global pandemic, citing that they needed to \\\\'sell the property\\\\' (when, in fact, it was promptly put back up onto the market to let at a reduced rate). They then proceeded to conjure up £2,000 worth of damages (amongst which, an extra £400 for cleaning when we paid £270 for a professional end-of-tenancy cleaning company to come in, with receipt as evidence), all of which we are currently STILL contesting through the TDPS.\\n\\r\\nIn short: nice place, awful landlord. Do not rent this property if you value honesty, decency, and holding on to your money. If it\\\\'s too good to turn down, take as many pictures as humanly possible before you even unpack a single item.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The property is in a convenient location, and the block is very nice and with a well-kept garden. The flat is of good quality compared to other properties I have seen, but probably not worth the £600 per month of rent, as asked by the landlord. The room is advertised as \\\\\"en suite\\\\\", however the landlord will use your bathroom (which is actually in the corridor) mostly for showering, and will not clean it. Large HD TV is a very nice feature of the flat, and nice views on parks and guildhall clock tower. Overall I would recommend this property, but be aware that the landlord might be particular about the way you may wish to enjoy the property. \\n\\r\\nTo prospective lodgers: remember that you will be a lodger and not a tenant. Lodgers in a live-in landlord situation do not enjoy the same rights as tenants of live-out landlord properties. As a lodger you will have to abide by the rules of the landlord, as unreasonable as they may sound to you. See below for some examples of how that might affect your stay.\\n\\r\\n The landlord works from the living room, which is not available during the day, and sometimes also in the evenings and weekends, so be prepared to not be able to use it at your convenience. This caused a major inconvenience during my stay, especially as no reduction on rent was agreed. The landlord wasn\\\\\\'t responsive to this issue despite my repeated complaints. I wouldn\\\\\\'t be able to use the room even before he started working in the morning, as this would \\\\\"cause a distraction\\\\\" to him. Use of the desk in the living room is not allowed even when the landlord is away. \\n\\r\\n The landlord is very concerned with keeping the property in a good state, perhaps limiting your freedom of action in the flat. For instance,  food is not allowed in the living room, or in the bedroom. Moreover, expect not being able to have friends round, which is seen as an inconvenience by the landlord even when he works from site and during daytime, as they would cause \\\\\"extra wear and tear\\\\\". Friends in the evenings are allowed \\\\\"infrequently\\\\\" as per the tenancy agreement (somehow that doesn\\\\\\'t cause \\\\\"wear and tear\\\\\") but expect the landlord to ask you to let them go after 11 pm (this has actually happened to me, and we were being very quiet and with the door closed. Eventually I stopped having friends over when he was there to avoid being embarrassed again by this behaviour.) By contrast, it has often happened that he would make noise after that time, including showering and cooking even at my request to stop that as I was going through a period of severe insomnia.\\n\\r\\nPartners in a long distance relationship are however welcome to stay up to a week per month, and the landlord has shown flexibility with more frequent visits, which I appreciated. He also showed respect for privacy.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"My wife was a tenant at this property for six and a half years. She couldn\\\\'t move easily - or she would have- because of personal circumstances, and the fact that everywhere else in Oxford was even more unaffordable. She never once went into arrears or broke any of the terms of the tenancy. Despite her loyalty and being an extremely \\\\'well-behaved\\\\' tenant, the landlady was extremely reluctant to spend money on anything. The property was old and run down and hadn\\\\'t been refurbished for years. Whenever fixtures and fittings legally needed replacing, they were reluctantly replaced with something cheaper or even older than the fixture or fitting that had broken. The property was broken into and burgled within a month of my wife renting it because of poor security. Then the landlady tried to charge my wife for putting new locks in! The washing machine broke over my wife\\\\'s first Christmas there, but the landlady waited for three weeks to fix it (leaving my wife having to use a launderette while she had a 6 year old and very young baby) because the landlady wanted to get it fixed on the final two months of its ten year guarantee. The repairman deemed it unfixable after all that, and the landlady replaced with a 6 year old machine, which almost instantly broke. Once, during a storm, a whole top window fell out of the external wall, including the rotten frame, on to the pavement below. Luckily nobody was walking below at that minute or they would have been seriously injured or killed. It was left boarded up for a month while the landlady argued with her insurers. The fence then collapsed.Again, it was left like that for about two months, because of more  arguments between t he landlady and her insurers. Then half the the liviing room ceiling collapsed due to the unsealed tiles in the bathroom  overhead leaking water into the walls. The landlady then made me and my wife pay out of  our own pockets for a hotel room for  a week while it was all fixed. There were countless other issues. All of the landlady\\\\'s bad behaviour was supported by the estate agents, who were rude and patronising and even aggressive at all times about getting \\r\\n anything  fixed, as if it was our fault - even though we were paying £1150 pcm for this two up-two down  property! (,I found out, was formerly a pig sty- for real!) We have  now moved to Hampshire and cannot believe the difference in our experience - we no longer feel ripped off or completely disrespected. It seems hard to imagine now how we used to be treated.\",\n",

I\\\\'m just in the middle of moving out of this property with one of my housemates and we have both decided to leave as a consequence of the landlord\\\\'s toxic behavior and unfair house rules. \\n\\r\\nOn arrival, the house was very clean and remained that way throughout my stay but I didn\\\\'t realise that this was as a result of his stringent and obsessive cleaning. In our group chat, we received sometimes up to 5 messages per day including pictures of minute spots of dirt and passive-aggressive messages stating that it was our obligation to keep the house to his standards. He used his housemate who he states is his \\\\'best friend\\\\' as a leverage point to guilt-trip us into cleaning, stating that his friend was always complaining about the house (which he wasn\\\\'t as he never mentioned anything to me and when I asked him if there were any issues he didn\\\\'t have any)! \\n\\r\\nAnother example of the unusual rules can be displayed in a scenario that happened last week. There were repairs going on in the middle bathroom (which me and my housemate use) and we were informed by the Plumber that we were to not use it for 24 hours. There\\\\'s a second bathroom upstairs and we asked to use it but he wouldn\\\\'t allow us to use the bathroom for just one day. He wouldn\\\\'t explain why and only gave an obscure and heated response when he shouted at me and stated that its his bathroom and he keeps it pristine and to his standards. \\n\\r\\nI can only describe my experience in this property as negative as I felt as if I was in a hotel rather than a house. I mostly stayed in my room and kitchen as I wouldn\\\\'t feel comfortable anywhere else. There wasn\\\\'t one day where there wasn\\\\'t a complaint from him regarding a switch, crumb stain or threat to evict us.\\n\\r\\nLast month he decided to increase the rent by £100 extra PCM because in his words he was undergoing \\\\'financial issues\\\\'. In light of this unprofessionalism, he did not grant me a new agreement and has stated that I owe him £110 for the last week of stay. I implore this landlord to rethink his understanding of what lodgers\\\\' rights are and to understand that other lodgers have their own lives and cannot feel as though they are under the radar 24/7. \\n\\r\\nTo top it all off he has decided to install cameras into the property in the front room, kitchen and hallway as he spotted me cleaning my shoes with the door open for 1 minute and confronted me in a passive-aggressive tone. At most times I felt confronted and very uncomfortable. \\n\\r\\nI would not suggest staying here and stay well away from this landlord\\\\'s next property viewing.\",\n",

The property is in a very convenient location, it is not only 15 minutes from the centre of Birmingham by bus but because of its location means areas such as West Bromwich where I worked during my stay here are also easily accessible. The estate that its on is quiet and seems quite family orientated. It is also worth mentioning that as a landlord Martin was very responsive and helpful. Overall I was delighted with my time at the property.',\n",

Within a month of moving in we began to get mould in our bedroom, on the walls and then in the wardrobe and all over our clothes, electrical s, shoes and furniture. It escalated into every room in the flat. We have had the landlord and environmental health inspect and nothing was done. We have 2 young children now and still nothing is being done. We have had a lot of problems with our boiler and washing machine which was provided by the landlord. It is still waiting to be fixed. The stairs are extremely steep and narrow, unsafe for everyone. I recently fell down them carrying my baby in her car seat. The banister is unsafe and can be climbed by my toddler. The windows, floors and skirting boards are all ilfitting and we have a constant breeze coming in. The kitchen cupboards are poorly fitted and we don\\\\'t have a proper worktop, just a piece of mdf. We have tried moving but are getting no help and I would not recommend this property to anyone.\",\n",

The downstairs bathroom is fitted incorrectly and due to this, often smells of sewage through the plugholes. This is a house that has been fitted to the minimum requirements (and probably as cheaply as possible), and problems were rectified by a handy man friend of the landlord. Broken tiles were \\\\'fixed\\\\' with red tape, the basement floor with 2 bedrooms always smelled damp (we were very kindly given 1 dehumidifier for the 7 bed house, lol), and the stairwell had paint peeling off the walls. The agents we rented from, Sugarhouse, either weren\\\\'t aware of these problems, or didn\\\\'t deal with them. This is a review from when I lived there a few years ago, so it may be different now, but this wasn\\\\'t even a particularly cheap student house - it cost us £301 pppm at the time, so the landlord rakes in over £25,000 a year from it!\",\n",

There was no ventilation in the kitchen or bathroom. the kitchen was in a hazardous place and blocked the fire exit from the bathroom and one of the bedrooms. there is no kitchen storage for food or cooking utensils. There are frequent drug users around the blocks of flats, and quite often groups of teenagers would congregate in the basketball court and playground opposite and be very noisy, drinking, and violent - we had to call the police almost every week. Poorly lit surrounding area, so it feels very unsafe. Communal areas in the block had dog urine. Really, this flat should have been a 2 bedroom flat with a proper sized kitchen and living area - the landlord has converted it into a 4 bedroom flat with a tiny, dangerous kitchen and no living area.

The landlord himself is not helpful, he will not reply to emails or pick up the phone.  The flat is nasty, it was a fit of madness that made us rent this.  The small bedroom and kitchen has no insulation so got down to 8 degrees in winter the rest of the flat has single glazing so also gets quite cold.  The bathroom has no ventilation so was covered in black mould after a month or so.  The boiler has a fault which the landlord told us to pay to be fixed and there is a leak in the central heating system somewhere.  Mice were a relatively regular occurrence.  The landlord was not helpful with any issues.  The selling point (a big terrace at the back) is being sold and tenants will lose access to it (although we were told this by the surveyors not the landlord).  At the end of the tenancy the landlord ignored me for a month and then tried to make deductions from our deposit.  However after I threatened him with court action he paid up in full.  His deposit registry account was cancelled as he broke the rules of the scheme, he registered the incorrect sum and didn\\\\'t provide the prescribed information as required by Housing Act 2004.  I am still considering court action over this.  The letting agent is equally unhelpful.  This is the worst place I\\\\'ve lived in since I was a student, please for your own sanity and mental health avoid.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Please note that the positive reviews below relate to the New Waggoners Inn, next door, not Waggoners Farm Barn. I can vouch for the pub. Excellent food and nice atmosphere.\\r\\nWaggoners Farm Barn,  we were there for 18 months and it’s probably the worst place we’ve ever stayed in. Having come from a converted barn, we are used to old buildings with their individual problems but this thing is something else. The roof leaked in a number of places due to holes and rotten Velux windows which the landlord continually patched up rather than replace. However the worst one is above the bedroom which is caused by the poor installation of solar panels and it leaks in directly above where the bed would go, so it’s a good idea to wear waterproofs when you go to bed and it’s raining. The panels would have to be removed and re fitted I was told to get to the problem.\\r\\nVirtually all the windows are rotten and the glazing blown, the inside has loose electrical wires that have been taped up. All the carpets are worn, tatty and stained. Be careful  as the landlord tried to blame us for this. The only thing that saved us was the inventory which showed the original condition.\\r\\nIf you rent, don’t expect anything to be done quickly.  When the alarm failed due to getting soaked by a leaking wall, The landlord pleaded poverty to us saying he couldn\\\\'t afford to get it repaired.\\r\\nThe garage door doesn’t work properly and the stop cock freezes in the winter as the insulation in the garage where it is, is virtually none existent.\\r\\nThen the central heating. The boiler is antiquated and will stay on 24/7 when the temperature drops, burning your very expensive heating oil. You cannot turn it off as the garage ambient temperature can drop to freezing.\\r\\nThe large room at the back is serviced by two cast iron radiators that are in-effective and a small log burner. You may as well light a candle for all the good that does. We had to vacate the room from November to May as it was impossible to heat. And the radiators are separate from the main heating system so are on all the time, not that it makes any difference to the temp.\\r\\nWhen we were there, the Aga didn’t work properly and was on maximum all the time and you could not adjust the temperature. The engineer refused to come back out because, in his words,  the landlord took weeks to pay their last bill.  This is also a real pain because in the summer you cannot turn it off as you have no alternative means of cooking, so you bake.\\r\\nThe back bathroom smells from the drains from time to time\\r\\nIt is very noisy being in the main road as you would expect\\r\\nIf you were to rent this, expect to refill the oil tank at least once every two months at a current cost of about £1000\\r\\nIf you are thinking of buying it, get a full structural survey done. We were told by trades men it probably needs £150,000 spending on it to get it to a decent standard and for that you could buy a house in a much nicer condition and in a far quieter, nicer location.\\r\\nI believe the owners described it as a palace to the letting agents.  You can judge for yourself, but I would say a dilapidated shack would be more accurate and decorated to a cheap and tacky standard in our opinion.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"I was forced to stay in an illegal, unsafe and unhealthy environment for 11 months. I rented the residence through a lettings agent, the landlord seemed a nice old lady (which was important as she was living within 10 feet of me), but once everything was signed and I was on her hook, she turned into a volatile, aggressive stalker.\\r\\nI was not allowed to park my car on the driveway I was paying for unless I reversed in, I wasn\\\\'t allowed to park with the back end of my car facing the street. There are no reason given for this demand.\\r\\nI wasn\\\\'t always allowed to use the parking spot I was paying for as the landlord liked to use the space for repotting their plants.\\r\\nThere was a leak in the bathroom taps when I first moved in, I was told this would be sorted, but I\\\\'ve moved out and the leak is still going strong, it has added to my water bill and wasn\\\\'t even my fault to fix.\\r\\nI was told when to turn my lights out at night, and if I didn\\\\'t, there is a switch on the outside of the house which the landlord would use to switch off my lights whether I wanted them off or not!\\r\\nI discovered there were lots of rats and mice within the property when I first moved in, but instead of paying an exterminator, I was told the property is old and the walls have cavities which mice and rats like to live in, so I could set my own traps if I wanted. Nothing more was ever done.\\r\\nWhen I first moved in I was told I was not allowed to move the landlord\\\\'s two rugs within the property, despite them smelling foul. Once day I rolled up one of the rugs and stored it safely away and hours later I got a text demanding to know where the other rug was. The landlord can\\\\'t even see into the property without entering it so this left me confused and scared.\\r\\nThere were also massive cracks in the walls and gaps in all the window sills which allowed hornets, insects and even birds into the property, which the landlord refused to do anything about.\\r\\nI enquired about getting my own bins as I paid council tax and required my own, but the landlord forced me to share hers and shouted at me down the phone one day when I asked, forbidding me getting my own bins as she didn\\\\'t want any extra on the property. This led to the council finding out she never put through planning permission on my residence. I pleaded with the lettings agent to let me out of the tenancy contract as it should have been void after the property was found to be illegal, but they refused.\\r\\nDue to the stalking and harassment on a daily basis from the landlord I had to seek mental health help.\\r\\nI have just moved out over a month early which has cost me direly, and the landlord has demanded a lot of illegal things of me since I had given her my notice, including sending me bills which I have no idea what they\\\\'re for, and billing me for things that aren\\\\'t in my contract. Again, I\\\\'ve tried getting help from the lettings agent, but they feel they have no duty of care to me as they are making money off the landlord.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'This was the worst rental experience I have had in almost 10 years so this will be a long post but please consider your mental health before you live here. It was a lodger situation but the complete lack of regard for someone else\\\\\\'s privacy and property was horrendous - privacy and autonomy were non-existent. \\n\\r\\nThe landlord walked into my bedroom without knocking while I was in bed and then stood in the doorway, and said they weren\\\\\\'t expecting me to be at home and in my bed. They then proceeded to walk further into the room to look for something (though why they thought one of their possessions was in my room I don\\\\\\'t know) and only stepped out when I asked them to because again, I was in bed in a state of undress and needed to put on a dressing gown. In the hallway, the landlord acted like I was insane for being uncomfortable with the situation and when I tried to bring it up later they would not agree to knock before entering the room. I was left extremely uncomfortable and never knew when they\\\\\\'d walk in unannounced again (the room had no lock). \\r\\nSimilarly, the bathroom door actually had a lock on it but the landlord would try to open the door, discover it locked, then continue trying to open the door which felt very threatening. \\n\\r\\nThis is a hygiene issue - the landlord would go to the toilet in the middle of the night and would not shut the door while they were on the toilet and then they wouldn\\\\\\'t flush! Every morning I would have to see their urine in the toilet, which is completely inappropriate when you\\\\\\'re choosing to rent a room in your home. Flush the toilet, it\\\\\\'s simple. \\n\\r\\nNot only was sleep difficult due to an incessant tapping sound at night (presumably due to the heating that is always on though never in the rented bedroom), but it was also absolutely freezing in the room. The landlord did explain the heating (though their understanding was limited) but, despite having never changing it myself, sent me accusatory messages about how expensive the heating bill was, seemingly unaware of the global heating crisis. \\n\\r\\nThe landlord went away on a trip and had their friends staying which was mostly fine but the landlord had obviously told them to help themselves to anything which meant that it was exclusively my food that was eaten without my permission, it was not replaced. \\n\\r\\nThe landlord was very intrusive in my life, I brought my belongings into the home and into my room and the landlord insisted on commenting on my possessions (which I now assume is because they were in my room and going through my things to \\\\\"look for something\\\\\"). They also tried to get me to throw stuff away. This was a personal thing, but I think a lodger is just as entitled to their privacy. \\n\\r\\nThe rental was advertised as a bedroom in a home with a SHARED kitchen, living room, dining room, bathrooms and parking. There was no private parking or parking outside the house (despite it being a feature in the ad). The landlord also does not like people owning cars (and yet exclusively takes Ubers or taxis) so lectured me frequently about having a car - my only way to get to work. \\r\\nThe living room was not shared. I used it once and the landlord got angry at me for sitting on the sofa so I had to spend all of my time in my room. The kitchen was shared but I got a tiny shelf in a cupboard, a shelf in the fridge and no freezer space. I was able to cook in the kitchen by myself once, otherwise the landlord would be in there lecturing me. I wasn\\\\\\'t able to use the dining room either. \\n\\r\\nThe landlord accused me of stealing packages and mail (it was then delivered a few days later). And then when I couldn\\\\\\'t find one of my packages it turned out that they had seen it earlier in the week, assumed it was for them (they hadn\\\\\\'t ordered anything and it had my name on it) and took it for themselves!\\n\\r\\nFinally, the landlord looked after someone\\\\\\'s cat and, when I wasn\\\\\\'t there, they would open the door to my room for the cat to climb over my bed (there were dirty paw prints all over the sheets) and go through my belongings. Again, total lack of regard for my possessions or privacy. \\n\\r\\nIn summary, this room was far too expensive for what was offered and I felt violated my entire time there.',\n",

Even if your roommates speak not very loud you cannot sleep because you hear them clearly.\\n\\r\\nThis landlord invented the rule that each room must clear the whole property twice per week. Toilet, kitchen, common areas etc.\\r\\nWhy not 3 or 4 times per week? This is totally unacceptable behavior because the property was in a reasonable good condition, we (tenants) were looking after it.\\n\\r\\nThe toilet was constantly clogged because it was not properly connected to the sewage, as a result, there were constant blockages and you just couldn\\\\'t wash it off, all sewage was floating and does not go away, you needed to clean it all the time. Even if cleaned, the next time it becomes clogged again.\\n\\r\\nThe overall landlord\\\\'s behavior I can describe as arrogant, you feel yourself like he is doing you a favor by renting out the poor quality rooms, probably he forgot that we are paying him the money, not vice versa.\\n\\r\\nI would recommend to fellows-tenants to Avoid this property and this Landlord, don\\\\'t waste your time and money\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The main issue is the damp and mould issue in the flat. Windows need to be constantly left ajar, even in the depths of winter. Any mention to this to the landlord falls on death ears with his response being to open the windows more, even when it is snowing. One day with the heating on constantly the temperature in the flat did not reach above 13.5 degrees (this was when it was snowing I will add). The external walls in the bedroom and it being a ground floor flat mean it is naturally a very cold flat at times. In the summer that’s great as it’s cool, but in the winter unless you can afford to have the heating on constantly it can become unbearable. We did suffer with black mould whilst in the flat. In 20 months I spent well over £100 trying to keep it under control, and not even so much as an offer of a dehumidifier from the landlord.....  The bedroom was the worst affected, but it also affected the lounge, bathroom and hallway. Despite keeping all windows ajar there was bad damp in the hallway which caused paint to fall off. And, then was charged for the cost of this out of deposit when leaving. Despite flagging the issue to the landlord on numerous occasions. To be fair to the landlord any other issues in the flat were always dealt with. Anything else he was always quickly on the case and had things sorted.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The flat is a good size, and bright. The heating system does not work properly - it involves lighting a match and trying to find the pilot light under the boiler. This was pointed out to the landlord at an early stage and subsequently several times, but not fixed by the time we left. The heating system is also not efficient in the slightest - the bedroom part heats up a lot, whilst downstairs barely heats up at all. However, the main problem as the other review points out is the noise - trains come past the flat all day/night, and unfortunately due to a nearby level crossing always horn just as they go past. This makes sleep/relaxing difficult.\\r\\nThe other main problem came in regards to our deposit. Shortly before the end of the tenancy, there was a noticeable change in attitude over emails from the landlord. The landlord then attempted to retain £100 for carpet/oven/wall cleaning at the end of the tenancy.  We strongly objected to this - both in terms of the amount and the fact that any extra cleaning was needed at all. The landlord was very unwilling to come to a fair agreement, and unfortunately we had to use the Deposit dispute process. Fortunately, having picked up the Landlord\\\\'s change in attitude, I managed to take photos of most areas of the flat during check-out to prove the condition that it was left in. In the end, the dispute service returned the majority of the £100 that the landlord sought to retain.\\r\\nThough the flat is spacious considering it is only one bedroom, I would not recommend it because of the noise, and landlord.\",\n",

People working the at the letting agency are highly unprofessional, they come in without written notice, do not take issues such as leaks, and rats and mouse seriously. When informed about rat problem first they completely ignored the issue and believed it is not their fault (a cleaner is hired by them to clean communal areas so they are responsible and the property is kept responsibly clean). I personally bough rats/mouse traps and scattered them around the house. A year later the same problem occurred but this time mice was found in lounge/kitchen area and in bedrooms! For obvious reason I reported it straight away to the agency, and they came into to the room looked around and said the mouse isn\\\\\\'t there anymore and asked me if I was seeing things! Very disrespectful and their only response was that \\\\\"it happens\\\\\"! It wouldn\\\\\\'t have happens if there weren\\\\\\'t holes in the walls in baseman and in the living rooms but once again they are taking no action. Thankfully I only have a month left at this property but unfortunately I already paid my rent, otherwise I would have moved out right away. \\n\\r\\nSave yourself time and stress and go to a different letting agency, they are the worst one around.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The actual property is nice - it could do with being repainted and the furniture was worn but satisfactory. The main downside to this property is the landlord - she is nitpicky at best and intrusive at worst. She is extremely particular about her property, insisting on professional cleans before the tenancy starts \\\\'as a courtesy to the incoming tenants\\\\' - except that of course she takes £300 out of your deposit when you leave. She is neurotic and when we discovered an awful cockroach infestation in the property within a month or so of moving there, she passively aggressively suggested that we had caused this, despite the fact that there were full-grown cockroaches and so many of them that it was impossible to have started less than two months ago. We had to calm her down as she was very stressed by the cockroaches even though we had to live with it, and berated us for not cleaning crumbs from under the toaster. This is also after she complimented us on how clean the flat is when she comes round. She went for a cheaper option to get rid of the bugs which ultimately didn\\\\'t work, and so we actually had to move out for five weeks while the house was fumigated. She \\\\'kindly\\\\' didn\\\\'t charge us rent for those five weeks that we were unable to live there and only properly fumigated the house when we put our foot down to say that the flat is uninhabitable - there were cockroaches in every room of the house at this point. When we gave notice to leave after a year, she voiced her disappointment, only to come round before we had even moved out to measure blinds and curtains, as well as point out minor scuffs on the wall, ask us to hoover the mattress and insist that everything was put back exactly as it was when we moved in (an ugly mirror on the dresser, the paintings back exactly in the right place on the wall etc). She made us feel so uncomfortable that we actually left the property while she remained to do more checks (?) - again, this is BEFORE our tenancy had finished. Luckily we had already moved to our new property as the tenancies overlapped. Overall, I would say it\\\\'s a shame that the property has such an invasive landlord, as the flat itself is lovely (sans cockroaches, which was solved eventually) and we were really looking forward to living in our first home together as a couple. Unfortunately, it was tainted by a £300 deduction from our deposit for a professional clean, which altogether was ironic given her house was full of bugs and we kept it impeccably clean. In short, would not recommend at all if you want to keep your sanity.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'This 5 bedroom property is rented out by a private landlord with his own agency “Smartroom rental”. Over many years of renting with them they have rapidly decreased in standard of service and speed in getting things repaired. The landlord is focused only on getting money and not about the people living in his multiple properties. They have put a homeless person in our flat as the legally cant rent it out as the room is too small but now they get an income. The flat smells of urine since the new guy moved in and the landlord is not doing much about it. He needed to make a room bigger and so he broke through one of the bedrooms walls and decreased the size of that room to increase the size of the other. They won’t give a reference 7ntil you give your notice to leave and they overcharge for any damage eg( small stain on bed and they wanted £200). The other tenant had to contact DPS to make sure they didn’t get away with it. In the end it was only a £30 charge. The will try take your whole deposit from you through outrageous charges. They have also tried to charge every tennant £20-£30 a month extra to have a barely acceptable cleaner in. I would just avoid this company as the stress and financial loss is not worth it.',\n",

Large front and rear garden, perfect neighbours. Reasonable rent.\\r\\nNegative elements - cold, damp and mouldy, most windows have no functioning seals and are draughty - this makes the property very expensive to heat - fixes were promised but never materialised. Very old kitchen in very poor state with painted tiles that flake all the time. Very poor carpets throughout with no underlay, again adding to the heating expense. Conservatory leaks very badly and is unusable, water ingress to the room adjoining the conservatory. Downstairs toilet is cold, damp and mouldy. Large garden is very difficult and time consuming to maintain as the landlord offers no assistance or tools. Landlord took weeks to offer a retention figure for the deposit which was very unfair and the amount requested unreasonable, we are still wrangling over the retention some 6 weeks after moving out. Overall the house is big but dilapidated and hard to live in. It\\\\'s on a very busy road and there is a constant motorway hum - made worse by the ineffective double glazing. Only the very bare minimum of maintenance is performed. Be very careful to ensure the initial inventory and subsequent inspections are 100% accurate and challenge everything that is not clear/ a true representation in writing - if you don\\\\'t you will be disappointed at the end of your tenancy - luckily we kept extensive notes/photos and fed them back to the letting agency.\",\n",

I have got the keys on 5th december and still living on my friend\\\\'s coach. first it took the landlord a month to sign the tenancy agreement.  the day i got the keys, both myself and the inventory company reported some issues with the washing machine, oven and myself about the toilet flush. this property is managed by foxtons and the landlord doesnt want any sort of interaction with the tenant. after approx. 3 weeks of non-stop calls and email they have arranged for the washing machine and the oven and cooker to be changed. on the delivery day the company couldn\\\\'t do nothing since they havent been informed the washing machine is filled with water although the landlord has sent her engineer twice in attempt to repair it. no correct measurement has been done and reported to the company for the oven and cooker and they didnt fit and there was a health and safety issue wit the cooker which needed to be changed to electric all together. so another day gone without any progress. the landlord is still not accepting the toilet flush is faulty although its been reported to the property management at the foxtons by myself treat the water doenst stop after flushing and she refuses to pay for any plumber fees to filter the water out of the washing machine. I have requested to be paid a compensation for the time i paid rent for the flat and couldn\\\\'t live in it and the landlord has refused to pay anything although she knows that i havent been able to live in the property. latest news i have received from foxtons is that they were trying to contact the landlord till the last minutes before christmas holidays to get permission to send their own plumber with their own costs but she didnt answer their calls. now its Christmas holidays and i have to spend at least another 2 weeks at my friend\\\\'s for everything to open again. please avoid this flat and this landlord by all means otherwise you will have the worst and the most miserable experience of your life. I think the way I have been treated was appalling and hope o one go through he same experience specially before Christmas which should be the happiest time of the year\",\n",

But only the living room had light during the morning hours, the bedroom and kitchen were hidden between houses and there was no light during day whatsoever. Because of this, the kitchen had constant mould and wet air - the agency sent someone to sort out the external (raining on the outside wall was a source of extra mould), but never sorted the interior (I\\\\'ve been told to buy dehumidifier if still an issue). The agency has a very helpful property manager, but because the landlord lives abroad no investment has been done to the house in years - everything looks, feels and smells old. After I left they reshaped the house (from 1 bed to 2 beds), which means the living standards went down (as they created a wall between the only source of light - living room - and the rest of the house). Also, the estate agents who rent the flat are completely unfair as an agency (very high fees; also, I\\\\'ve paid extra for furniture, but they provided super low quality products), so I would not recommend the agency or the property.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"I moved to this property as it a shared house. The 4 tenants 3 females and one male were nothing but nasty to me while living in the property. One girl banged on my door at 3 am accusing me of keeping her awake. I called the police as I was afraid for my safety as I only just moved in and was not sure what she was capable of. The police did not turn up at all they said if she disturbed me again to call them. I reported the incident to the agent and the agent who is a woman did nothing about it. All she did was agree I was making noise and dismissed my feelings I expressed to her that I felt afraid. She showed no remorse or anything. I told her I reported the tenant to the police. The next day the female tenant was complaining about me to the two female tenants. I could hear her repeating the things I said to the agent via email. Therefore the agent set the female tenant on me and does not know anything about confidentiality. \\n\\r\\nThis female tenant the next day after called the police and told the police that I tried to stab her. I was so shocked and in disbelief. The police could work out the female tenant was lying that banged on my door at 3am and told her she was wrong. I told the agent in my email when I complained about the female tenant banging on my door for her to tell the tenant not to knock on my door again but the harassment continued. The other three tenants then started banging on my door. They made my life a living hell. \\n\\r\\nAlso, 2 months after I moved in the agent threatened to send me a section 8 just because my ex called the cops to my house to accuse me of harassment (which was not true) it was my ex that couldn\\\\'t handle me breaking it off with him). The tenants are the ones that called the agent when the cops came the agent did not even listen to me why they came over. She made me feel so intimidated. \\n\\r\\nI then had my mental health affected over the months because of the tenants and agent. I had to go to the council and get a Case Worker to contact the Landlord to investigate the agent and the tenants. But the Landlord did nothing they ignored my cries of suffering. I really believe the agent is biased and the tenants are racist. \\n\\r\\nI went to court this July as the Landlord applied to court without notice to me and my solicitor and I was able to suspend the possession order. I have no job and can\\\\'t even move out so will have to see if the council now can step in to help me with permanent housing before I end up homeless. I don\\\\'t know what the outcome will be by the end of the month, but it is scary how people can get away with destroying your life and trying to character assassinate you. Do NOT move to 4 Lindal road. The tenants, if you are ethnic background, will discriminate against you especially if they know you are a single young woman.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Lovely property. Easy access to public transport and local school. Nice area didn’t come across any trouble in the area. Landlord used a letting agency however the landlord himself was exceptional. I had an issue where my bathroom was flooded. As I was a downstairs tenant there was a blockage in the sewage pipes and therefore every time upstairs flushed their toilet or had a shower it was coming up through my toilet. Bathroom got completely flooded and was disgusting. The landlord personally came out to the property to deal with the situation. He brought his own towels and cleaning products to help so that I wasn’t using my own to clean up the mess. He stayed at the property until the issue was resolved and personally got in touch with people he needed to to get it sorted. I couldn’t have been any more grateful for him and his help. Great guy and great landlord! We need more landlords like him!',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"I have lived at 63 Queensway during two years and it has been a hell of a mess. \\n\\r\\nFirst of all the landlord is not someone you want to be dealing with. He will do the less when it comes to repair and is unfairly trying to claim my full deposit back. I just don\\\\'t think he is someone fair and square. The lack of assistance from the landlord was to say the least unimaginable. I asked so may times for small repairs that needed to be done but he just never cared. \\n\\r\\nThe good think about the property is probably the view. The location isn\\\\'t great since its far from big supermarkets. Close to Queenspark though. I don\\\\'t think the price asked is worth it. I found cheaper bigger and better as I just moved somewhere else. The property is furnished, The bed is comfortable enough and the storage in the bedroom is big. The couch in the living room and the desk chair are horribly uncomfortable. They should be replaced, which I asked for so may times, but the landlords never agreed to that. Again, his lack of flexibility speaks for itself. \\n\\r\\nWhen I moved in, the first night, there was a leak from the ceiling in the bedroom that stained my duvet! I could not use electricity during a couple of days for the leak to dry. It was cold and could not use the heater and I had to sleep in the living room. I have been reimbursed one night from the landlord.... a proof of his human kindness.  The leak stained the ceiling. The ceiling has never been painted during my two years at the property despite my numerous email to the letting agency that was Fox and Son while I was staying there. I suppose this will be fix at some point for the next tenant. The lack of response is again one fo those example of people not caring from both the agency and the lanlord. \\n\\r\\nThere is a mould issue in the porch. This is due to humidity. it\\\\'s pretty bad. This has never been fixed. This is a building/property issue. The isolation from the windows is not the best either and relates to the humidity issue.  \\n\\r\\nThe bathroom has no ventilation system and no plug socket!!! The water pressure is not the best but manageable. The bathtub has a leak inside but the landlord never changed the piece that caused it because its just one expensive bit to change. This caused my bathtub to always have the side panel unfitted and open so the worker who used to come to do some maintenance work could do some sort of hack and access it fast. Again, things not done properly. This worker stopped working for the landlord as he had enough of being unreasonably  annoyed by him. \\n\\r\\nThe apartment has carpet and that is ok but it will need some professional work to be cleaned. In terms of heat the heating works well. Electricity is fine. The plants come with the apartment you have to deal with them else the landlord will make you pay for them.  \\n\\r\\nThe place is not that sunny but not that dark. I wanted more sun so this one was of the reason why I moved. It gets dark very fast as the apartment is not facing west. The kitchen has everything needed. \\n\\r\\nBig moth INFESTATION during spring and summer. I never had moth before. They come specially when the weather gets warm. You can even see them in the hallway of the property. I think it\\\\'s a building issue. \\n\\r\\nTHE WORST OF THIS PROPERTY:\\n\\r\\nA DRUG LORD LIVES ON THE SECOND FLOOR. THIS WILL DISTURB YOUR NIGHTS AND TAKE YOUR SANITY AWAY. \\n\\r\\nThe drug lord has people coming in and out all the time. We had to create a case with the police and the council to have notice of closure. But it seems he just repeats patterns. He will be quiet for a while and then it ss another go to the party. Noises during the night, fights, screams, strangers, blood, urine and needles in the staircase. I have seen girls having overdoses or being unconscious in the grass outside the property.  I had contacted the agency about it and got no answer what\\\\'s so ever from Fox and Sons or the landlord as they just didn\\\\'t care at all. If you need a quiet place to live, just don\\\\'t bother with this one and do yourself some good. \\n\\r\\nI was paying 900 but the landlords raised the property to 925. That was also one of the reason why I moved. The property is worth 850 per month max really. I accepted it because I was desperate for a flat at that time. \\n\\r\\nIf you have a car its a hit or miss for parking. The street is on a slope, narrow and  has traffic all day. I didn\\\\'t have a car and I am happy I didn\\\\'t. \\n\\r\\nHappy to be contacted if more info are needed . \\r\\nCheers\\n\\r\\nAl\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Ive had boiler problems since i moved in 3 years ago.\\r\\nThe landlord doesnt repair things correctly, he always has to be here when a gas engineer or plumber comes for repairs and wont let them fix it properly E.g Hot tap on the bath was loose, you had to hold the tap to turn it on or off. Instead of letting the plumber take a tile off the side of the bath to tighten the tap he told me that i would have to just keep holding the tap to turn it on or off, i told him the tap gets hot bus was called a liar until he tested it himself.\\r\\nThe landlord turns up as and when he pleases, uses the excuse that he was next door so thought he would pop in. \\r\\nIve had his sister in law demanding to get in the house and because i wouldnt let her she started to record through my patio doors so i had to shut my curtains. I told her she wasnt allowed. Ive had to call the police as they will not remove themselves when they turn up unannounced. \\r\\nThey havent secured my deposit....twice...they didnt give me the energy performance certificate when i asked for it, i had to remind them twice. \\r\\nThe boiler was infact wired up incorrectly which the engineer and the landlord tried claiming on the warranty which is illegal. This is fraud. The day my boiler blew i complained about the wiring,  Now the landlord is lying about it saying it wasnt wired up incorrectly but i video recorded the engineer telling him so. \\r\\nThey have just been underhand, dodgy in every way shape or form and im not the first person for this to happen to as he was the same with another single mother.',\n",

After living here, I have development serious mental health issues and encountered so many problems.\\n\\r\\nFirstly, the properly has single glazed windows, however they lied on EPC where it says double glazed. Further, it has Storage heaters that don\\\\'t even work and not charge overnight. It also has mould problem and doors are so bad. You literally can\\\\'t sleep in the bedroom in winter because it is so cold. Unless, you want to spend 1500£ - 2000£ per year in electricity bills, please stay away. As the property is so old, things keep getting broken here and there. And the landlord/agency is mostly unresponsive and won\\\\'t fix things.\\n\\r\\nI had such a terrible experience with one of the neighbours too who was a drug addict just living upstairs. Because of the poor insulation, the noise was so bad I could not literally sleep for days. And the police/other people keep coming to the building in the middle of night.\\n\\r\\nThe things I had to endure, I don\\\\'t even wish on my enemies. You will thank me later.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The flat is built on a back alley (it\\\\\\'s called \\\\\"canal walk\\\\\" but you can\\\\\\'t see any bodies of water), facing the back of a restaurant and several flats. Because of the many households sharing the rubbish bins, plus the food waste from the restaurant, the bins are constantly overflowing with a terrible smell. I always have to hold my breathe when I go out of or come back into my apartment. The smell comes into your apartment in the Summer, and there are constantly 4-5 flies flying in at any time. The noise at this alley is also ridiculous, ranging from the pizza restaurant sawing wood for their wood burning oven (this lasts several hours), to the motorcycle coming in and out, to neighbours shouting and screaming in the middle of the night... There are many flats directly opposite your main window which makes you feel like you\\\\\\'re constantly exposed unless you keep your blinds drawn all the time. All in all, it feels like living directly on top of a landfill. On the other hand, the location is OK as it\\\\\\'s around 15 minutes walk from Blackheath or 20 minutes walk from Lee. But that\\\\\\'s not amazing - we\\\\\\'ve witnessed people being robbed on our way home, twice. And given the actual condition of the flat, I don\\\\\\'t think anyone should pay more than £1,200 - £1,300 for this.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"So far have had almost 30 repairs which have required us as tenants to take time off work to be around for. Roof leaked for the first 6 months of tenancy. Electric shower constantly breaking. There are now 3 different types of windows in the property due to constant repairs (from the start of the tenancy until now still ongoing). Wonky floors. Previous tenants rubbish left in the garden. Wheelie bins were full of builders waste when we moved in, council couldn\\\\'t take the bins for 2 weeks as the rubbish wasn\\\\'t even bagged up. Boiler has broken twice, radiator has leaked into the basement now the basement light doesn\\\\'t work. Washing machine constantly breaking as it\\\\'s so old. We had a gas leak due to a faulty hob. Living room is always freezing as the sliding doors are old and not sealed properly and the radiator doesnt work. Landlord increased the rent by 10% after all of these issues. Landlord doesn\\\\'t use reputable companies for any of these repairs, seems to know a bunch of cowboy builders that often don\\\\'t show up when they are supposed to and often don\\\\'t do the work they are meant to when they do show. My own property has been damaged during repairs and it has taken more than 6 months to come to a resolution. I don\\\\'t reccomend this property if you want to live in peace.\",\n",

We were constantly woken up by the noise. The flat is also not good for work from home due to the small size. Water leaked from the ceiling in the kitchen area and in the bedroom. The gas meter is behind the parking area of other flats and you would need to jump down for about 2 meters to take the reading. You will need to be strong to climb back up and so we were unable to take the gas reading for the whole period staying there. The people attending inventory check also rejected taking the readings.\\r\\nWhen we moved in, the flat was not cleaned and very dusty, as stated in the inventory report. We requested for a second cleaning, which was still not done to a professional standard and thus we had to clean the flat ourselves again. But due to the extra costs incurred, the landlord has made it difficult for deposit refund when we moved out, making unfair comments. It is still not sorted.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'A lovely, spacious top-floor flat in a fairly quiet neighbourhood. Liked the place so much that I ended up staying for two years. \\n\\r\\nNever had any problems with plumbing, electricity or structure of the property, although slight mould build-up around the windows in the winter. Gas heating system was very efficient and kept the place nice and warm in the winter. \\n\\r\\nApartment is well-lit throughout the day. Unfortunately this was occasionally an issue as no curtains/curtain rails were provided and instead the flat comes with basic blinds that do little to block out the light when you are trying to sleep (more of an issue during summer months, naturally).\\n\\r\\nWas not given induction by landlord, check-in was performed by a ‘check-in agent’ who, despite being friendly enough, did not know much about the flat or where anything was.  \\n\\r\\nOn-street parking available, although spaces can be hard to find if arriving home late in the day. \\n\\r\\nTraffic on road outside can be fairly loud and intrusive but if you’re used to living in a city it probably will not bother you. \\n\\r\\nOn very rare occasion that property has required repairs the landlord’s agents were quick to send around their handy-man – a lovely bloke who prides himself on attention to detail – and as a result most issues were resolved very promptly (although on occasion the agent may need reminding)\\n\\r\\nNeighbours are generally very friendly and quiet, although we were very rarely (<5 times in two years) disturbed by residents in the social housing block of flats a few doors down when they had parties/domestic disputes. \\n\\r\\nOnly real issue with the property is how thin the floors are – I lived alone as did my downstairs neighbour and as a result neither of us made that much noise. However, being an old, converted house, I could unfortunately hear much of what was going on downstairs e.g. talking, doors closing, even coughs and sneezes, and I don’t doubt my neighbour would have been able to hear me upstairs too. If either property had particularly loud people living there I’m sure this would significantly impact on the neighbour’s enjoyment of their flat.  \\n\\r\\nSadly in the last month of the tenancy I had an unexpected altercation with the landlord. Throughout the two-year tenancy the property had been managed by an ‘agent’ who, owing to them both having the same last name, was clearly the landlord’s daughter. Throughout the tenancy she was fairly incompetent and unreliable but owing to the fact she was quite young and that she would, with enough prompting, get issues sorted eventually this did not pose too much of a problem. However at the end of the tenancy, when she began arranging viewings for prospective tenants, her lackadaisical approach meant that she invariable arranged viewings with less than 24 hours’ notice. This was not a big problem until, one weekend, she contacted me at 5:30pm on a Saturday to let me know she had booked no less than ten separate viewings for Sunday at 12pm. As I had friends coming over for a party I replied saying that this was not appropriate and that she should reschedule. The agent did not think to check her emails until 10:30 on the Sunday and when she did she became hysterical; she called me immediately and let loose with a torrent of abuse before alternating between threatening me with litigation and pleading to my better nature. When that did not move me, she went crying to her father, the landlord, who then called me and threatened to come to the property, let himself in and attack me unless I backed-down and let his daughter show the tenants around. Sadly, faced with the prospect of at best having to fight a middle-aged man, or at worst have to fight a lengthy court case to get my deposit back, I acquiesced and asked my friends to go down to the pub while the viewings went ahead. \\n\\r\\nAs a result, as much as I enjoyed my time in the property I could never recommend renting anything from this pair of self-important sociopaths. If you do end up renting from them, be prepared to deal with a petulant and emotionally unstable child of an agent and a violent, unhinged landlord.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Positive: Spacious living room connected with small kitchen space. With two sofas and a table that could be used as an additional room. Two bedrooms, each having a double bed, with high ceilings. One bedroom is small, the other large. Router is between the two rooms in the corridor and allows for fast internet. \\r\\nGood and kind landlord, not pushy open to discussion on issues with the flat. Responds relatively quickly. Gets repairs/replacements done. Modifies the flat/appliances when in need. Took the carpet and made the floor in one bedroom into a wooden one when a tenant was having severe allergies and requested a change in flooring. Got double glazed windows (although smaller room is still cold most of the year without constant heating). Got a new fridge, microwave. Replaced a broken washing machine, shower, kettle, bathroom sealant, floorboards that were making noises. Painted the bathroom. Got PAT checks and Gas Safety checks.\\n\\r\\nNegatives: Boiler is located in bigger bedroom. As such it makes noise when hot water/heating is running and bathroom noise can be heard as it is connected (sharing a wall). Router placement in living room is not advisable as the signal would reach the bedrooms but it will be weak.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The landlord was very helpful throughout the entire tenancy and always eager to fix any problems we encountered. During the tenancy, the landlord also had the wood panelling repainted and after notifying him about the condensation problem in the bathroom he arranged for it to be repainted to a more appropriate paint which aided the problem significantly. There was a slight condensation in the biggest bed room and in the bathroom, but that was mainly due to lack of air circulation during the winter months which is common. \\n\\r\\nThe property was in very good condition when we moved in and had no problems during the tenancy. Overall, a very pleasant and enjoyable letting experience thanks to the landlord who went above and beyond in ensuring all our tenant needs were met. Would definitely recommend the property and the landlord.',\n",

Only single glazed property on the road so very cold and loud. Landlords attempted to put the rent up despite all the above concerns plus more and only backed down once we refused.

Gave us 1 hours notice that they would be coming to the property although they knew she was on night duty asleep. Rarely gave us 24 hours notice for appearence or would ignore our concerns all together. Shower broke and refused to replace it for a month and a half. Only fixed things when the people downstairs complained (water leaking down to flat below - we had informed them of leaking).

       "  'comment_body': 'The house is in a lovely cobblestone street. It is bright and spacious. It is however in a poor condition that requires major renovation. The walls and the roof leak when it rains, which results in the mould forming inside. Despite this issue being fixed to some extent last year, it still persists. The kitchen is dated, fridge accumulates ice, furniture and the oven were damaged from first day we rented it, and it was never fixed. Also, there is a problem with spiders. There are hordes of them on the ground floor, as there are many uninsulated gaps and corners in the kitchen where they hide. The spider problem has never been addressed by the agency either, in spite of reporting.\\r\\nThe fuse box is also very old, sometimes causing problems with electricity.\\r\\nAlthough the landlord replaced most of old windows and initially absolutely unsecure and faulty doors, windows on the top floor are still the same, with one window being broken. It cannot be closed properly which causes drafts and occasional leakage.\\r\\nThe agency has been fairly responsive to reports but only to fix essential issues, such as clogged drains. It however took a long time and usually many reminders to get things fixed, e.g. it took four months to fix a leaking wall. \\r\\nIn the end of tenancy, the landlord claimed the entire deposit. While one charge was agreed upon, the rest were for repairs for damages that we did not make. Given that we bought many things for the house that we left there (vacuum cleaners, bookshelves, desks that were essential and improved its value), inventing reasons for deductions is absolutely repulsive.\\r\\nThe house has a lot of potential to become a really great place if renovated. However, in its current condition, it might not be the best option to rent.',\n",

They have grown quite rapidly over the past few years and it\\\\'s partly as they keep tenants deposits by whatever means possible, they have a reputation for doing so.

       "  'comment_body': 'Worst experience of renting ever. The flat itself was pretty bad. Single pane windows overlooking a very busy road. Lots of pubs nearby so drunken fighting was regular into late hours. Keeping warm was an issue. Damp and mould almost everywhere. But by far, the biggest problem with this property was the landlord, who is also the managing director of the letting agent office below. And these are the reasons why:\\r\\n1. A month after we moved in, they wrote to us (IMAGE #1) advising that they would obtain entry for an inspection between the hours of 1pm - 5pm on the 8th Jan 2015, and if they hadn\\\\\\'t heard from us to the contrary, would \\\\\"bring their set of keys\\\\\" in case we were not in. This clearly amounts to entry without consent. Agents were acting on behalf of landlord, who was also their boss.\\r\\n2. Having signed for a six-month fixed term, we were contacted by letter (IMAGE #2) and asked to confirm our intentions at the six month point. The relevant charges were all laid out, except one that had NOT been drawn to our attention prior to the signing of the tenancy. We had guarantors for whom we had to pay £80+VAT x2 (credit checks) and we also had to pay £80+VAT x2 for each of us as tenants (credit checks) - but landlord/managing director ALSO sprung on us a further £80+VAT for \\\\\"rent guarantee insurance to guarantee the rent.\\\\\" Which - as well as not being made aware of at start - is precisely what the guarantors do, and what we paid £80+VAT x2 to accomplish..!\\r\\n3. Before we moved in, the landlord informed us that our gas bill was a shared bill...shared with the lettings office. They stated that they paid 60% of the bill and we had to pay 40%. They gave us NO further information. They way it was presented was misleading, because we thought we had struck a fair deal. But it was far from fair. When the first quarterly bill arrived (IMAGE #3), the landlord had calculated each percentage and dropped a note through the door demanding we pay £518 for three months gas (IMAGE #4). Although the flat was a six bedroom property, the top floor - consequently three rooms - had no heating at all. Not only that, but all hot water was done via the immersion heater - therefore, from our pre-paid electricity. What we found out, was that the bill - totalling £1,296 - was in fact a business account bill which incurred a much higher rate of VAT. Not only were the office bound by Health and Safety Laws to keep the office space continually heated throughout the winter, but the rates were not the same as domestic gas use, and domestic gas would not have incurred the same VAT. This - I felt - was information which was not only absolutely crucial to the fundamental agreement to share the gas bill, but which had been withheld from us when making the agreement. The Property Ombudsman Codes of Practice in fact place a very strict requirement on agents to disclose all relevant information like this when making agreements. It has - arguably - the effect of rendering the term a Statutorily Unfair one. \\r\\nAs each of these issues occurred, I\\\\\\'d made a complaint. After complaining about the final matter - the gas bill - the landlord evicted us. She later claimed she evicted us because I\\\\\\'d been abusive. The Council found in her favour, and concluded we were \\\\\"intentionally homeless\\\\\" despite the utter lack of evidence from the landlord to substantiate her claims...In fact, all the letters and emails I supplied to the council clearly showed that the landlord evicted us as a direct result of my three complaints. \\r\\nI would never, ever recommend this place to ANYONE.',\n",

The only option is to use a mixed water bucket.\\r\\nThirdly, Catalytic converter theft is rife in that location, mainly because there is no CCTV cameras in the private car park. The compound has a barriered entrance but the care taker has given keys to people outside the property and no one bothers to close the barrier at night.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Huge house for what, in Edinburgh for this scale, a competitive rent... you\\\\'d expect a trade-off, and there are quite a few (and those become more obvious after you\\\\'ve lived there a month or two).\\n\\r\\nFirst, this place gets cold. The letting agent won\\\\'t make this clear when showing you round, but none of the gas fires are connected, and the landlord is not willing to pay for the necessary work to make them functional. There\\\\'s a single boiler - most properties in this area have two - which really needs to be left on all day in the winter to maintain acceptable temperatures. The windows are single-glazed, and a roaring wind comes in the back of the house. Our energy bills were enormous - around £300 on heat and light per month in the winter. I don\\\\'t recall a single warm evening in the winter, despite that.\\n\\r\\nSecond, the plumbing is very basic. The water system can supply only one tap/toilet/appliance at a time - so if you\\\\'re taking a shower, and the washing machine is on, or if someone fills the kettle, or runs a bathroom sink downstairs, brace for the water just to.... stop. On a cold morning, that starts to grate very quickly. It takes a good while to fill a bath.\\n\\r\\nThird, the whole place is very tired, and no more so than in the kitchen. The oven\\\\'s baffling, the grill doesn\\\\'t work, the enormous electric hob makes annoying beeping sounds if you look at it the wrong way and the scuffed work surfaces will never ever look clean. Elsewhere, the peeling and stained wallpaper doesn\\\\'t look great, and wall-to-wall beige carpets are a pain when you have a young family. \\n\\r\\nFinally, Belvoir are your typical letting agents; just about competent in sorting out the mandatory swift fixes (the boiler broke down a couple of times and got sorted quickly) but slow on the rest, and occasionally rude and patronising along the way. Check the inventories carefully - don\\\\'t let them get away with not recording pre-existing stains, marks and damage, because our outgoing inventory seemed a lot more stringent than the incoming one (although we made it clear we had plenty of photographic evidence, and got nearly all our deposit back). And don\\\\'t let them charge you the repair fees for things that should have been fixed by the landlord!\\n\\r\\nThis could be a beautiful house, with a huge garden in a wonderful location. But it needs hundreds of thousands spent on it to bring it into the 21st century. Tenants beware.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'X1 Lettings – Town Hall (Manchester) Review - apartment 94 (not on list)\\n\\r\\nAfter such a terrible experience of renting with X1 Lettings I would like to inform others of what I have experienced in order to prevent further people being ripped off and left frustrated and angry by this letting agency. Whilst staying in one of their studio apartments between 09/19-/03/20 I experienced a number of issues from day one of moving in. Here I have only highlighted the main ones. \\n\\r\\nWhen I first arrived to the flat it was dirty, with hairs and crumbs in the kitchen drawers and drawers under the bed (p.1). There was food waste in the drainage part of the dishwasher (p.2) and both the fridge and oven were greasy and grimy. Clearly the flat had not been cleaned, never mind professionally cleaned. But this wasn’t a huge problem for me. The problem is that they had they cheek to make the following deductions at the end of my tenancy, after I had spent all day making the apartment spotless:\\n\\r\\n-\\tx2 extractor bulbs - £20 (Lights I never used…)\\r\\n-\\tmattress clean - £35 (A mattress that had a mattress protector on it…)\\r\\n-\\tchair clean - £35 (A chair that was dirty when I arrived and couldn’t be properly cleaned…)\\n\\r\\nAfter emailing back and forth I managed to get out of the first two deductions but had to settle on paying for the chair clean (I doubt it was or ever will be cleaned). And that’s not all. After spending the whole winter in that flat I noticed there were gaps in one of the windows. One between the window frame and the pane of glass, over 1cm (p.3). And the other between the two sliding window frames (p.4). These gaps were allowing cold air to fill the room and consequently I could hear every sound from outside. I had essentially wasted money on heating that went straight out the window: the one radiator in the studio was below the windows. My complaint about the window was not taken seriously by staff at X1 Lettings so I contacted Salford council instead. The council were very helpful and informed me that they deal with a lot of complaints about the apartments in this building. They presumably spoke with X1 Lettings, urging them to do something about it as it was immediately dealt with after the council’s inspection. One of the gaps was sealed with silicone whilst the other one was not seen as a major problem, for some reason I cannot understand. I received no apology or reimbursement from X1 Lettings and gave up trying to fully resolve this issue. \\n\\r\\nThe fact they allowed a tenant to move into a dirty flat with broken windows shows how negligent and unprofessional this rental agency is. Making unnecessary deductions from deposits further emphasises their greed and complete disregard for their tenants. If you are looking to rent with this agency, I would advise you to not rent an apartment in Town Hall. You will have problem after problem. The building is falling to bits and they have made a have hearted attempt to create rental apartments within this building. The apartments are cheap and nasty – inefficient heating, extreme condensation and mould (p.5). If you have a problem that needs fixed, it will be swept aside and never dealt with. I cannot speak for their other properties, but I would advise anyone to avoid renting with X1 Lettings. In my experience the staff are rude, dismissive and unsympathetic.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Landlord has been quite.. inappropriate shall we say? This is a house share of 5 tenants. They share kitchen facilities only as the bedroom rooms are double en suites. \\n\\r\\nHowever since then it’s been a nightmare of a tenancy. This is a HMO (house of multiple occupancy). He is a live out landlord who lives 3 hours away in Birmingham . No property management company involved. He has a PA in the Philippines and one contracted handyman. \\n\\r\\nA previous tenant didn’t pay rent, he harassed him and the landlord asked tenants to spy on him, cut off his water supply, cut off his internet access  and join in harassing him, to which the tenants declined. He even asked one other tenant to open his mail (which the tenant declined!!). \\n\\r\\n2) Builders kept turning up to paint rooms with zero notice, therefore disturbing the peace. Also he books viewings for other empty rooms with zero notice and people keep turning up to view with zero warning. \\n\\r\\n3) One of the rings on the hob broke, the law states in a HMO 4 rings must work per 5 occupants. Reported it and it took over a month to be fixed. \\n\\r\\n4) In October the water stopped working entirely for a day due to a broken pipe outside. Landlord was texted when it happened (sadly was at 10pm, but we couldn’t shower, flush toilets or get a drink as shops were closed already) and the landlord was not sympathetic and just sent us dramatic texts like ‘be thankful you don’t have an infection people have it worse!!!’. Luckily it got sorted the next morning. \\n\\r\\n5) Landlord harasses female tenants. Asks them constantly out for dinner/lunch dates and makes inappropriate comments about their appearance.\\n\\r\\n6) The landlord keeps asking current tenants to take previous tenants items to the bin and the tip, but they’re his legal responsibility.\\n\\r\\n7) A letter came to all occupants stating a warrant was issued to search the property. The council turned up a few weeks later and said our landlord has no HMO licence, he applied 2.5 years ago and never continued with it, he’s been on their radar for months. This is a criminal offence. \\n\\r\\n8 ) When tenants move out he makes excuses to not pay the deposits back and the law states 10 days. Also sometimes he doesn’t put some people’s deposits in the deposit protection scheme (one person for 3 months!) and the law is 30 days! \\n\\r\\nThe council advised all 5 of us tenants who were there at the time apply for a Rent Repayment Order to get up to a max of 12 months rent refunded due to the lack of HMO licence. They said as we have signed agreements and can prove we’ve paid rent with bank statements, and our deposits are in the deposit scheme we will win hands down. They’ve made it clear he’s a rogue illegal landlord.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Good points - Property was mostly very nice and we were pretty happy to stay for a second year. We very seriously considered staying for a third year. Three good size bedrooms and one very small one. Living room was very big and kitchen was reasonable. Garden was a nice addition, but was small and didn\\\\'t have any privacy from neighbours. The area is very well connected with good access to shops, the northern line, a big morrisons and sainsburys, camden nightlife, and primrose hill.\\n\\r\\nWater/heating - There were some very significant boiler issues during the tenancy. It broke several times for extended periods over the winter, and the heating was never really up to scratch, as a result of a centralized boiler for the whole block of houses. The boiler also once leaked through and nearly collapsed the bathroom ceiling. When this was being repaired, the plumber warned us he found asbestos, and the managing agent would never provide us any asbestos safety records when pressed.\\n\\r\\nNoise/safety - The property is very loud as it is in central camden. People would regularly be playing music and partying outside until the early hours of the morning on weekend nights. Even with these surroundings, the neighbour was militant at making noise complaints if we ever had a party. There was at least one mugging/assault in the park out front during the late night, but the business of the area meant we never felt in danger. \\n\\r\\nManaging agents - The principal managing agent (Little Estate Company) was very slow and would always avoid doing things if he could. We learned his colleague was much better, and we would try to speak to this colleague whenever we could. The managing agent was also quite rude once we told him we were moving out, and even got into a shouting match with one of the tenants over the quality of the end of tenancy professional clean. Deposit was returned smoothly. We had negligible contact with the landlord.\",\n",

Some that were very threatening were fixed quickly (eg rotting floor boards in the first floor bathroom which could have caused a ceiling cave in into the kitchen and new lock on the door after a burgalry ) were fixed quickly  but not necessarily very well . we had a clause in the contract about professional cleaning , but even thougb a professional inventroy company noted the property was generally clean toa  professional standard, we still got charged with a 400 quid bill and had a broken gate charhe (which was broken when we moved in ), 2 keys copied due to 2 keys being missing (although only one was not properly returned but was posted - so it was assumed to have arrived ) and the cost of broken mirror - again fell of the wall and was not a fault of ourselves  taken off our deposit at the end  . WD queried this and the landlady communicated , got fed up and just sent is the reduced deposit and would not communicate with us further  . we had 5 people living in the house in total and we all worked  so we needed use of the downstairs bathroom showed , however this was broken for about 3 months before it got fixed  . Estate agents and the handy man would come round to the house without prior warning  . landlady was often patronizing and rude  . Most of the jobs done took time if they weren\\\\'t urgent and we\\\\'re often done to a standard that meant the problem was likely to repeat  . one of the flatmates had bad mould in her to the point where she spent all her time in her partner\\\\'s room, who also lived with us. The landlord / lady insinuated that it was our fault although there was potential for the mould to have been caused by a blocked / broken drain outside the bedroom    . the property was not in the best nick and on moving in was not well done , despite it supposedly being professionally cleaned  . would not recommend this property to anyone .\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Beware: The worst-managed property of our life. It doesn\\\\'t look it, as the flat itself looked very nice, but this was the worst property we\\\\'ve ever lived in. What has made our stay there a living hell was the absent landlords and their incompetent property management agency. The landlords live in Australia and every maintenance request took long weeks to answer - and usually with a refusal or a perfunctory response. And we had to work hard for even this poor service, chasing and sending reminders. The management property simply ignore your e-mails. Unless the landlords were obliged to fix the issue by law (and you\\\\'d be surprised how narrow the list is - we\\\\'ve become an experts now), nothing got fixed. We moved into a flea-ridden property (from the previous tenants\\\\' cat) filled with building debris. We spent 5 nights in a hotel and had to force the landlords to eradicate the fleas. The hotel expenses and removal of debris were never reimbursed.  The entrance light took close to 18 weeks to fix, with the tenants having to chase the property management for a response. For 4 months we needed a torch to enter our home. The garden tap, the hob and cooker, the vents, the shutters, the windows (most broken or painted shut) and massive damp - were never fixed. The worst problem was severe damp, with black smelly mould growing in every room of the property - during our entire tenancy (pregnant and then with a newborn baby) this was not fixed at all. Beware - this was not evident in our viewings of the property.  The poor care of the property and the terrible landlords have made our life there very difficult and this is the only reason we have left at the end of the first tenancy period. We have lived in more than 10 properties in 3 continents and this was without doubt our FLAT FROM HELL.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The drain pipe directly above the front door does not connect to any outlet pipe, so whenever it rains the water gushes along the wall above the front door and into the property when the door opens. The bathroom has a severe damp and insulation problem with visible black mould forming within two weeks after cleaning in winter. Similarly, the main bedroom has constant mould formation at the windows and furniture left in this room is prone to forming a grey layer of mould (the heating in the main bedroom is insufficient to warm the room up). Furniture in the main living space is also prone to mould if left against the outside wall. The shower has cheap plastic lining which visibly has the sealant broken and black mould exists underneath it. Periodically I found slugs inside the property. Another outside drain pipe in front of the kitchen window is broken and has algae forming along the wall on the outside. The outside light at the front door is broken so you can\\\\'t see anything when accessing the property at night. Despite clear communications early on in the tenancy with the landlord concerning the bathroom and shower damp and mould problem, the outside light, both drain pipe issues and the slug infestation, none of these were adequately resolved (the landlord had a new extractor fan fitted in the bathroom which did not resolve the damp issue nor the mould problems that this caused).\",\n",

But it is not a great house. In the winter, the walls barely stop the cold at all, the small room at the rear of the house, which I used for a living room, is uninhabitable in the winter months. The house doesn\\\\'t have a central heating system so electricity bills are sky high as you need about three heaters in the small room to be able to sit in there at all. There is also no escape from noise, it has two sets of windows, but you can never remove yourself from the busy junction, as every room is facing a road somehow.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Living here was uncomfortable, it was always in a state of disrepair, it was untidy at check in and every repair was a major hassle to organise. Most things needed more than one repair as the entire time the landlord was just looking to do things cheaply. The agents expect a lot of help organising everything and are very rude and we had an almost total lack of quiet enjoyment a lot of the time. When we left there was horrible damp and leaks that had been there months, attempts to fix were useless and required more expensive work the landlord basically didn\\\\'t want to do. The toilets are a nightmare, the plumbing wasn\\\\'t done properly and the loft one blocks and spits up into the sink, the main one is dirty and old and it doesn\\\\'t flush well. I waited 6 days without a main toilet and was ill and confined to that floor a lot of the time, The decking was repaired after 2 years but was rotting at entry and we had to constantly ask them to fix it. Leaks all over the place with stains on 4 different ceilings. This is just a landlord that doesn\\\\'t want to spend any money and gets the cheapest person possible to do minor repairs instead of proper ones. The electrics are terrible, the oven is always turning the whole of downstairs off and then it won\\\\'t go back on. The water pressure has to stay on halfway so you can only ever use one outlet at once. The paintwork is horrible, they\\\\'ve used chalk paint or something that easily comes off and makes the walls dirty quickly. There was a hole in the floor under the carpet in one room and many places that were weak and likely to go too. The landlord asked for a rent increase on the week of lockdown when we had a few months to go and were having to wait for viewings! We are being asked now to pay for the frosted glass sticker the landlord placed on a window because the mould spread into it and created a pink warm mould underneath it that was certainly not safe. Our sinuses are much better after moving.  We would NOT recommend anyone live here because the agents and landlords are not going to look after you, they don\\\\'t care at all and the place needs extensive work done.\",\n",

I have asked the landlord to reset the timer, as we were not allowed to turn the heating on by ourselves when it was needed, but there was a complete lack of understanding. On the contrary, the landlord started to complain that the bills are too high and stopped answering my messages on any topic.\\r\\nAlso as it was my first time renting in UK I didn\\\\'t know what type of contract to expect so  I\\\\'ve found out  later that the landlord has given me a lodger contract instead of an AST even though he was not living in the house.

Had to pay as they take a holding deposit which is non refundable. Naivety taken advantage of. They didn\\\\\\'t provide us with enough keys. Just one, which we had to go and cut for the rest of the tenants and didn\\\\\\'t refund. Agency and landlady always blaming each other. \\n\\r\\nLandlady was horrible. Said she\\\\\\'d  have the house cleaned before we moved in. It was left in terrible condition. Loads of stuff went wrong. Leaks, ceiling falling down, blocked drains etc. She would take ages to fix them and would just do patch jobs and they would happen again. \\n\\r\\nAt end of tenancy landlady tried to take our full deposit for made up reasons and we had to chase her through the courts and eventually and rightfully got it back.

The fridge door wasn\\\\'t mounted properly and was always coming off; we had to re-secure it every 2-3 months. There was meant to be a combination washer/dryer but in the end only a washing machine was installed so we had to go out and buy a dryer, which there wasn\\\\'t really space for.

       "  'comment_body': 'Just to be clear - my property was the flat under Sure2Move. The address was Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road, London SE23 3HN. The only reason I have put it as the address above is that my address doesn\\\\&#39;t come up on the postcode finder and I was advised to do this and clarify the details. I never dealt at all with Sure2Move - all of my dealings were directly with Landlord. My story of renting from Landlord is as follows. I moved into the Garden Flat, 53A Dartmouth Road on 1st September 2008. While until recently we enjoyed a fairly amicable relationship, Landlord was historically been negligent about attending to structural repairs in the property. For example, within my first few months of moving in, I had occasion to complain Landlord to the council over his inaction in protecting the property against pigeon excrement. On the 26th October 2011 I first let him know about the damp issue. No action was taken on this till 2015; and while the damp in the main room was repaired (due to a faulty pipe on the outside of the property, for which the permission of Lewisham Council was needed), the wall is still exposed and as Lewisham Council pointed out when they came around on 19th February 2016, there were mould spores there. There also is clearly damp along the main alley-facing wall of the flat. In April 2014, renovation works started on Landlords’s son’s flat above. I did give Landlord permission at the time to store building materials in my courtyard, on the understanding that they would be gone by July. In June 2014, I told Landlord that I had witnessed rats in the backyard. It took until November 2014 for some of the rubbish to be cleared; however a good portion still remains in my courtyard to this day – a courtyard that is included in my contract. Between June 2015 – January 2016 I recorded leaving my keys with Landlord&#39;s handyman and so-called property manager  at least 20 times over a combined period of approximately 40 days, so he could repair the damp, clear the backyard, fix an exposed area around the boiler and latterly, arrange for the building to be re-spiked against pigeons (during the renovations some spikes had not been replaced). There are a number of texts between myself and Landlord and myself and Handyman to this end. At the end of October I informed Handyman that I had spoken to someone at Lewisham Council, and I intended involving them if action wasn’t taken. No action was taken, so on December 4th 2015 I informed Landlord that I intended to get the council involved, to which he made it very clear that he was aggrieved. He has alleged since that he arranged for all these jobs to be done from January 6th; however I never received any notice for him to visit the property, or indeed any inkling that this was in hand. I was promised by his handyman  by phone that the back garden would be cleared and the pigeon spiking would be done by January 19th. This didn’t happen, and I was subsequently promised that it would happen by January 26th. This also didn’t happen On February 11th or 12th, I contacted the EHES team at Lewisham council and arrangements were made to come visit the property on the 19th February. On February 17th I let handyman know by phone that the council would be coming, and on February the 18th I left a voicemail asking to be kept informed. Later on the 18th February a Section 21 was in my postbox. I was emailed by landlord on the 19th February to let me know it was there. I did not reply and then was texted by him on the 22nd of February. I phoned him to let him know I needed more time to consider my options, and he seemed fine with me taking a week or so. On the 24th February I emailed him (email already with Lewisham Council). He replied on the 24th February offering a reasonable increase in rent to £750pcm (although a steep increase at 36%, I felt if the issues were dealt with in the flat it would be a price worth paying for the remaining months I intended to stay, due to immigrating in the autumn to Germany). I did not reply to him, but on the 25th February he texted me to tell me he was reconsidering his offer, as he didn’t like the ‘tone’ of my email (which had been seen and approved by Lewisham Council as being reasonable and balanced - their take on it was that he was \\\\&#39;lucky\\\\&#39; that I was giving him such an easy way out of an illegal eviction). Later that day he texted me to say he rescinded his Section 21 but would be happy to rent it out to me at ‘market’ value (in his estimation, £900pcm – which is at least £100 over the market value of similar-sized properties in the area which are at a far higher maintenance level structurally). I emailed him back that day to say I would need professional advice and I would get back to him in a few days. Later that night, at 22.18pm, Landlord sent  me an email with his timeline overview, an assertion that I won’t want to pay £900pcm and telling me he had found a room in a houseshare property for me in the area via Zoopla. At this juncture, I had already decided to re-visit SHIP Housing Options at Lewisham Council upon the advice of one of their call centre operatives, which I did the next day. To say that Landlord is increasingly erratic, harassing and intimidating emails and texts were stressful is to state the obvious. Moreover, his handyman  had a copy of the keys to my flat, which made me increasingly uncomfortable. Lewisham Council really tried to help me by mediating with landlord, but to no avail. They subsequently sent me an email trail in which he basically said he had been giving me a cheaper rent all these because he thought our relationship was \\\\&#39;more\\\\&#39; than landlord and tenant. He alluded to an episode of which I had made the council already aware of, whereby I missed a month\\\\&#39;s rent in 2011 due to financial hardship, and he told me to pay back only half when I had it - which I did. However this does not negate the fact that he was happy to rent out a substandard property for 5 years after, during which time his rubbish from building was stored in my courtyard, and I had to endure almost two years of building works in the property above. During that time my kitchen was flooded twice, and it was only due to a conscientious electrician that the lights in the kitchen were repaired. Recently when a BT operative came to inspect the wiring in the estate agents above which was apparently connected to mine (I had no idea about this in the almost 8 years I lived there) she made it clear that it was a hazard waiting to happen. It is clear that his sole intention is to harass me out of the property, by setting a rent that is a 64% increase on what I had been paying, and with no indication that he intends to do anything about the structural maintenance issues outstanding. It transpired that he may have some involvement in a property development happening close to the flat and that his intention was to use my flat as the site office. I was forced into a position whereby I felt I have no choice (for a number of factors, including my own personal safety) but to vacate the property by the end of April. Lewisham Council kindly stepped in to give him my notice, and it seems no coincidence that on the day they did that, one of his workmen jumped in over my wall \\\\&#39;to retrieve tools\\\\&#39;. I contacted Lewisham Council immediately and said to them if they felt it was appropriate to warn landlord that if he trespassed on my property at any point in time during the rest of my tenure, or harassed me in any way, that I would involve the police. I do not know whether that message was passed on. I left my property under duress and because (as it was explained to me by Lewisham Council) I was scuppered by the lack of regulation of private landlords which might have entailed me having to pay Landlord court costs. While I would have preferred a more amicable end to my time in the place I’ve called home for the last almost 8 years, it became very clear to me now Landlord, despite his protestations to the contrary, has had never any intention of fulfilling his legal obligations as a landlord to maintain the property structurally except when it was absolutely unavoidable (as when my kitchen was flooded a number of times from upstairs). There was been a huge toll on my health, physically and mentally, both in terms of living in a property that is well below market maintenance and also in the energy expended in trying to get landlord to fulfil his obligations as a landlord. Landlord owns a number of properties in the area – some of them in a similar state of disrepair from what I\\\\&#39;ve seen – and in my experience of him as a landlord, he tends to rent out to those who might be considered vulnerable i.e. immigrants, women etc. My intention in writing this on Ask Tenants is so other potential tenants looking to rent in the Forest Hill area can avoid dealing with landlord at all costs. According to Lewisham Council, he is now on their watch list of rogue landlords. I have taken a number of video clips and would be happy to post them if useful.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Key points: \\r\\nThis Landlady ignored my concerns. \\r\\nIrresponsible. \\r\\nFacilities are left below standard for extended periods of time without explanation. \\r\\nImpossible to contact. \\n\\r\\nThere were issues with the electricity in the kitchen early on. This left the other tenants and myself without the ability to boil the kettle or to do a load of washing without tripping the fuze. Obviously this was very inconvenient. While I was living there, at least 4 different \\\\&#34;repair men\\\\&#34; came to fix the problem (Some of them even came without any Tools). This went on for at least 3 months (from 31.12.2015 till 5.4.2016) and the problem was still there when I left. \\n\\r\\nThe shower pump also had stopped working so the pressure in the shower was depressing. This problem took around 2 months to fix. I would ask for an update on the progress once a week or so - this request usually seemed to be ignored. Her daughter was living in the house too in the upstairs room. She took on the task of spying on myself and the other lodgers, reporting to landlady when we had guests stay overnight which I was only aware of after Landlady decided to with-hold part of my deposit of £50 per week for an extra guest. This amount was never discussed or mentioned previously. I had also had a discussion with her before taking the room about my girlfriend being able to stay occasionally (who was my only guest) as we lived in separate countries. She of course was fine with this arrangement on an \\\\&#34;occasional\\\\&#34; basis but still decided to withhold £85 of my deposit. She also decided to charge me £20 for some damage to the fridge seal. (Which the photos I took on vacating the flat on my last day show no damage). To this day I have not seen a receipt for the repair or evidence of the damage itself, she simply decided to keep my money. \\n\\r\\nDuring my stay there, landlady had gone for a holiday to the Caribbean for several months and she only arrived back to London after I left the property. This was fine but she was impossible to contact 99% of the time. Each time I needed to contact her about something, I would text her and email her and also give her a call (which she very rarely picked up her phone) to make sure she knew I was trying to contact her and to please get back to me. Weeks would go by and nothing so much as a simple txt saying &#34;I&#39;ll get back to you soon&#34; was received. Just complete ignorance. I would send a follow up message, text and call her and leave a voicemail. Again this was ignored time and time again. \\n\\r\\nHer daughter was of a similar attitude, as she took responsibility for &#34;Handling&#34; the repairs to the property - when I was unable to get a response from landlady, I sent her a txt asking for a simple update about the repairs so that I can know that something is actually being done about it. (My messages were always courteous and professional). She replied to my txt soon after: &#34;contact your landlord, im not your landlord&#34;. It was clear from then that she was not interested in being at all helpful. My main issue with this property and landlord is not that repairs weren&#39;t attended to in a timely manner or even that landlady took my deposit. Landlady and her daughter were just plain ignorant. Landlady clearly had no interest in managing the property, it has become apparent that she just wanted to take as much money as possible from her lodgers while putting in the least amount of effort. After landlady sent me an email advising that she was withholding some of my deposit, I sent her a professionally drafted email requesting a receipt for the repair and to discuss the amounts she had decided to withhold. This email was also ignored and I have not received any reply in weeks. \\n\\r\\nDon&#39;t move in here and avoid this property all together. Good luck finding a nice place, there are good spots and good landlords out there, I just know it! :)',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The property is modern and bright. The bathrooms and kitchens are fairly new and modern. However, there are mould issues. One of the bedrooms has mould all around the skirting and in the wardrobe. As a result, personal possessions are completely destroyed by mould. The landlord painted everything in anti-mould paint but the mould still came back. The bedroom really smells of damp so I think it\\\\'s an issue within the building. There is also mould in the bathroom and actual mushrooms grew through the grout! The handyman believed there was a leak in the upstairs flat which caused all of this (as you could often hear water running down the internal wall) but he never investigated it.\\n\\r\\nThe flooring is quite poor and coming up in places. The kitchen has been designed very badly and has very little space to store anything.\\n\\r\\nIt\\\\'s a shame because it could be a nice flat but the upkeep is really neglected and mould issues are not taken seriously.\\n\\r\\nSome of the neighbours smoke a lot of weed constantly and the smell can come into the flat too which is frustrating.\\n\\r\\nThere is a bus stop right outside which can be very loud. This also leads to lots of rubbish accumulating around the front of the property/front door step. Even though the landlord owns the whole block, as far I\\\\'m aware he doesn\\\\'t organise for this to be cleaned and individual tenants have to clean it.\\n\\r\\nThe landlord is not good. I raised the issues of mould multiple times and his only solution was to paint over everything in anti-mould paint rather than address the root cause.\\n\\r\\nWhen the handyman visited he said he thought there may be a leak upstairs which caused the mould, as you could hear water running down the wall. He kept saying he would investigate this but never did.\\n\\r\\nWhen I left, I asked the landlord for compensation as so many of my possessions had been ruined by mould. He essentially said the mould was my fault for not airing the room properly so he would not be compensating me. The issue is that the room has been fitted with vents on the outside walls and the wardrobe doors which suggests to me that this has always been an issue, otherwise they would not have been installed. My flatmate also informed me that the previous tenant had issues with mould too. The room was as well ventilated as it could be given that it was a ground floor, front-facing room on a busy road in London, so the windows couldn\\\\'t be constantly open for safety reasons - I\\\\'m not too sure what the landlord expects tenants to do. I also had the extractor fan on for hours after I had a shower, but the handyman told the landlord that he visited the property and I didn\\\\'t have it on. It seemed to me that they were all working together to cover up the mould issue because they couldn\\\\'t be bothered to find the cause.\\n\\r\\nCommunication is also incredibly poor. We communicated with the landlord via his secretary who was unhelpful. She doesn\\\\'t reply to emails unless you send multiple follow up emails and call her.\\n\\r\\nWe would often communicate directly with the handymen when we needed something fixed, due to the secretary not replying. They couldn\\\\'t commit to which days they would visit, often 3 days later than initially agreed and acted with no urgency when we had serious issues.\\n\\r\\nWhen you leave the property, the landlord doesn\\\\'t pay you back the deposit directly and you have to wait for the new tenant to pay you. They don\\\\'t ask the new tenant to pay you as soon as possible so you can be left waiting for ages after you\\\\'ve moved out for them to pay you. This could be resolved by the landlord managing the deposit better.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The main issue we have undergone was that our landlord entered our house several times when we were absent without notifying us in advance. He was also very aggressive on several occasions when we have had disagreements, especially with my flatmate.\\r\\nAnother serious issue we have had was that the flat was very cold throughout the whole winter, we complained many times, but nothing was done. The bills were included in our rent and we offered to pay more if he were to raise the heat, but he did not.\\r\\nThere was a leak in my room as I was away, it stained the walls, my bedsheets, etc,... and nothing was done. He even reproached me for the stain on the wall when I handed in the keys.\\r\\nWe live in the basement of the house, and there are people living upstairs. Their kitchen was above my room and the noise was a nuisance all year around, there is no insulation whatsoever. The worst was the washing machine that was often on late at night.\\r\\nThere are a lot of spiders around the house, and from the scratching noises we hear at night, we believe that it is likely that there are rats upstairs.\\r\\nWhen we handed in the keys, he threatened us with taking part of our deposit back fr things that were already damaged when we first entered the flat.\\r\\nThere is also a huge problem with waste management in the neighborhood. There is litter on the floor constantly.\\r\\nOther than that, the area is close to the university (30 minutes walking), Asda, the curry mile. The bathroom has been refurbished recently.',\n",

This led to severe mould. We dealt with a bee infestation near the roof that the landlord initially refused to reimburse us for.\\n\\r\\nHe refused to fix the front broken gate and we constantly had to make our own repairs around the property due to it being so poorly maintained by the landlord. At the end of the tenancy the tenancy agency strongly advised the landlord to put in new carpets, but the landlord refused.

As a result of this, mould and damp occurred in every room which was never corrected (one room was changed so that the wardrobe was covering a serious patch of damp/mould prior to a potential new tenant viewing). We were also blamed for the thermostat being broken despite it being an issue since before we moved in. Landlord takes days to respond to messages about the house, then will not take action unless prompted multiple times, when we are met with verbal aggression.

The landlord has raised the price over £400pm in the last 2 years and is no longer worth the cost\\r\\n-You are living above a function room (club for rent) which is used most Fridays and Saturdays and will be open and noisy until 3/4am on these days\\r\\n-Area is unsafe during times the club is open (shootings & antisocial behaviour)\\r\\n-There is a bad drainage problem which is almost impossible to fix, the landlord will try to charge you for repairs even though the problem has been lasting for years\\n\\n\\r\\nListing : https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/86664456#/?channel=RES_LET\\r\\n(Pictures are not up to date)',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'This property was a first rental after the landlord refurbished the property. They moved away and decided to rent the property. We were the unlucky ones to rent it. It has MAJOR problems with leaks. The labour used to refurbish the house was extremely poor and cheap. Everything used in the house was ikea style or bellow. Cheap MDF throughout. There is a MASSIVE MOULD ISSUE throughout the house. It started as a problem in the first six months of our tenancy and NEVER FIXED. To add to the problem the landlord blamed my family for it. It’s a STRUCTURAL PROBLEM, a landlord’s responsibility. The landlord is not easy to deal with and a one sided brain. Leaks, electricity, broken handles, broken tiles, garden in extremely poor condition because of lack of water drainage causing a pond to form during rainy days, mud is also formed. Makes the garden slippery and not suitable for use. Rotting sheds. Extremely poor decoration. Walls dirty and left full of hooks and nails from previous paintings hanging. Private items left by landlord including personal family photos, safe, old sofa, old boxes, old side table and even an old sewing machine that we STORED FOR FREE for them. Broken light bulbs left behind. Illegal installing of a light pendant in the family bathroom causing the bulb to EXPLODE out of nowhere. The carpets are bad quality even difficult to hoover. Cracks on the walls throughout the property. Pieces of plaster fall on us. Curtains of very cheap material barely work. Look worn down and dusty. The floor is extremely difficult to clean. HIGH MAINTENANCE. Very high electricity bills. Paying over £600 a month. Poor appliances. Major LEAK under the kitchen sink causing rotting. The sink is placed on top of the worktop and it’s not sealed. Water leaks every time you wash dishes. Major light bulb problems. Be prepared to change bulbs on a daily basis. Poor plumbing throughout the house. The main/ en suite bedroom is in terrible condition. The water comes through the leak making the bedroom wet. Sleep with an umbrella. The side gates are broken. Access to the back garden is free. Alarm system broken. Taps break all the time. Showers clogged. It’s not a great property. And the landlord is unreasonable. Be wary before making the choice to rent this property.',\n",

Months later and surprise surprise, her daughter is moving into my old room. If you wanted to make room for your daughter in the flat then you should just be honest about it, rather than fabricating a conversation (to save face I suppose?).\\n\\r\\nMy other issue is with charges from my deposit. I was charged hundreds of pounds from my deposit for a new kitchen worktop, even though the worktop was already damaged when I moved in. The landlord actually assured me, to my face, that I would not be charged for this. Apparently honesty means nothing?\\r\\nThe other charge that is absurd is that the door handle was broken the entire time I lived there, and after reporting it multiple times, was never fixed. The landlord came to fix it once, but basically she put it back on, without fixing the problem. So it slid off again immediately. I reported this again and nothing was done about it. I had to live without a door handle for an entire year, keeping a sock in the door to keep it from shutting so I wouldn\\\\'t get stuck inside. And I got charged for it. It\\\\'s a joke. The people living in the flat are amazing people, good friends of mine. The management is shocking. Please find somewhere else to live for your own sake.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"My housemates and I struggled greatly throughout this tenancy. When we moved in the old tenants hadn\\\\'t even moved out yet and the property was filthy, we struggled to get hold on the landlord regarding these issues and when we requested the flat be cleaned professionally he threatened to essentially end our tenancy straight away. I had a broken bed that was never replaced, I ended up having to remove the old bed and buy a new one from my own packet just so I could have a decent nights sleep. \\r\\nThere have been multiple issues with the flat throughout tenancy, leaks, damp. Builders constantly turned up without any prior warning and let themselves in having being given a key to the property. There were times when I was upstairs and only realised anyone was in the property because I heard drilling from downstairs. We had to constantly chase the landlord for things to be resolved and fixed, getting sporadic and often rude replies. It never felt like there was any genuine care for the property or us as tenants. \\r\\nI would strongly warn against renting this property, even if the flat Is done up to a higher standard in the future the attitude from the landlord and property manager will remain the same, and I can safely say, it is not worth the stress, hostility or difficulty. And certainly not worth the rent you will pay.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"In general, this was a stress free tenancy. The gas and electric are inexpensive - below average quote by electricity provider - and the location is nice and safe. Kept getting the smell of cannabis from potty neighbours though. The boiler kept having issues that meant I needed to manually reset the pressure using a valve underneath it. I started doing this myself after some unfortunate gas man was called out in the wee hours to do this, which takes one minute. In the final months, the kitchen started to show its age, and shelves began to collapse while drawers fell to pieces. Complaints to landlord yielded only a visit to assess the problem, but I imagine this should have been fixed now we have moved out. An out of order drier remained on the property for the entire tenancy, despite complaints and requests to dispose of it, as we didn\\\\'t need it anyway. That said, the landlord repaired radiator issues and replaced a washing machine quickly, and our deposit was also quickly returned.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"We were hugely disappointed with the landlords behaviour and management of the property throughout the tenancy. They remained in breach of our tenancy agreement from day 1 and never made any real efforts to change that. We continually raised issues within the flat i.e. mice, broken dishwasher, suspected damp (raised in fact by another landlord in the building), curtains that didn\\\\'t close, mis-wired elections, broken hob, back doors and windows that did not shut properly leading to security issues and concerns over valid insurance - to name a few. In addition the landlords tried to have the property valued and put on the market without our knowledge by instructing sales negotiators to say they were \\\\'surveyors\\\\' helping the landlord re-mortgage. They then proceeded to agree to only have it on the market for 2-3 months and in fact kept in on for nearly 5 months without engaging with us at all, an on one occasion sending quite rude emails in response to our obvious distress at the situation.\",\n",

On viewing the property, all seemed tidy and he seemed pretty decent. \\n\\r\\nOn moving in, I discovered that the boiler / heating system was faulty - ie there is no hot water on unless the heating is on full blast - the wheezy water tank is in my room. Landlord is aware of this and refuses to fix the issue.\\n\\r\\nHe also claims he has the boiler serviced and annual safety inspections done - but is unable to provide evidence.\\n\\r\\nThere is also regular leaking of water from the bathroom into the electrics into the ceiling below - again, the landlord refuses to fix this and claims this is NOT a safety issue as it doesnt leak all the time and that their is no risk of an electrical fire if water gets into the wiring as it will self-regulate.\\r\\nFurther, the landlord lives like a pig in a sty - his washing, dishes, DIY goods, childs toys, empty bottles, beer cans and other clutter litter the house everywhere - there is NO access to the communal areas ie dining table and lounge as these are filled with his junk. \\n\\r\\nIssues have also included the kitchen tap breaking - as he was going away, he refused to fix it and for a week there was no running water in the kitchen - even for a few days after he was back - he would go to the garden and get water out the hose tap to fill the kettle!\\n\\r\\nWhen he has massive binge drinking sessions, he and his friends are out in the garden all night - weeing all over the paving, being sick in the kitchen sink - this too is not cleaned for days.\\n\\r\\nOther pleasant habits of his include having loud sex with his girlfiend with his door wide open, enjoying \\\\\"himself\\\\\" - again with the door wide open to his room - its cringeworthy!\\n\\r\\nHe has also had endless issues with the poor old lady next door - they share a chimney breast which was on the verge of collape. The poor old lady was so worried however my landlord REFUSED to pay his share of the costs and REFUSED to admit it needed to be replaced and had this poor lady stressing for months until he finally agreed to pay the costs he is obliged to.\\n\\r\\nThe garden is a hazardous construction site - wood and nails and rubble debris everywhere.\\r\\nI have tried raising the issue with him, and said that I am paying rent for a property and it needs to be clean and that he has basic legal responsibilities - he has said he does not, and that I rent a room and that its HIS HOUSE and he will do what he wants.\\n\\r\\nI am a female - he also regularly wanders around the house in his underwear or no clothes at all.\\n\\r\\nAs for his bathroom habits - he leaves his shavings everywhere, has no idea how to clean mould off the walls, leaves globs of toothepaste spit in the sink, wees all over the floor when he is drunk, leaves his marks down the loo bowl - I have to spray with bleach and disinfect after he showers - its FILTHY!\\n\\r\\nA bonus point - despite the dangerous boiler and electrics - there are no working smoke alarms or carbon monoxide testers in the house. Landlord deems these unnecessary too. \\n\\r\\nI honestly dont know of any living or dead creature that would or should live here.\\n\\r\\nWorst bit is he has a 6 year old daughter who visits and creates more mess - and who at the age of  is still sleeping in bed with dad. He is often very drunk or hungover and sleeps away on the sofa while she is left to her own devices - eventually the poor kid climbs on him and I find them there on the sofa the next day. Its very sad.',\n",

Our landlord said our electricity bill will be near nothing due to the fact that there are solar panels. However, once we moved in, we then found out that none if the power the solar panels generate goes into our electricity bills, instead they go into our landlords’ bank accounts, and of course we don’t get any discounts on our electricity bills.\\n\\r\\n2. Before moving in, our landlords said they wanted to save having to get rid of some old furniture (sofa, chairs, beds, chests of drawers), so asked if we would use them, if so they can leave them here. But if we ever want to get rid of them and get our own furniture because they were quite old, then we can do so. So we agreed because it saved them having to spend money and effort, and we didn’t mind having them in our home temporarily. However, they now said that they want everything they left behind to be here in perfect conditions. \\n\\r\\nDuring Covid, when most landlords have given help to tenants, reducing rent, delaying rent or even canceling rent, we did not receive any help, nor did we even asked for it. And when it comes to us asking if we can have a 5-month contract or a rolling contract for 5 months after being here for two years and not missing one rent, they refused to do so and chose to kick us out early. We asked to have a 5-month contract rather than 6-month contract because we are moving to another country, and now we are left in a very difficult situation because we don’t know where we can go after the date they wanted us out and before we move. We even asked if we can just leave two weeks after the date and they still refused to.\\n\\r\\nThere are also many other moments when we felt that we were forced by our landlords and Spencer & Leigh to do certain things which are totally unfair, and felt that we were not treated with any respect.',\n",

It\\\\'s a terraced house that is converted into 2 studios on the ground floor, a 1 bedroom flat on the first floor and studio in the garden. I lived on the ground floor road facing studio. Curtains need to be closed at all times as people on the road can look right into your flat. Bills are included in the rent except internet. The boiler is placed in the communal area and is locked. The landlord keeps the key and heating is controlled by a timer. The heating is switched on during GMT for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening. I had to buy my own heater without the landlord knowledge as the house tends to be a cold storage and the landlord refuses to turn on the heating for longer hours. There is lots of damp and mould. The landlord refuses to treat the damp but just paints over the damp when new tenants move in. I had to buy a dehumidifier as the landlord did not see an issue. Mice get in from below the kitchen sink. Fortunately, there was a door to close the cupboard so the mice doesn\\\\'t get out. Can\\\\'t keep any food inside as mice would eat it. The landlord adds foam to the hole but the mice chew through the foam and he refuses to block the hole. The front and back yards are garbage dumps. The oven did not work when we moved in. The landlord replaced the cooker with another old cooker from another property after 10 months of begging.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Signing up and Check-in process\\r\\nThe Good - The viewing process was easy and uncomplicated with the agent being able to answer any questions we had. Similarly in terms of signing the documents and providing proof of ID this again was quite seamless. Phone calls from your end were prompt and informed. We appreciated this. Terry’s work putting up pictures / hooks etc was also well received. \\r\\nAreas where we felt let down – The Referencing agent you chose, KeySafe Ltd. KeySafe provide no tenant contact details, charge large fees and, in our experience did little to help tenants move through the referencing process. We provided details of referees to KeySafe who told us no-one answered when they emailed, this despite my being in the office of my previous letting agent when KeySafe stated they had sent the email. We faced long waits for this process, and in all honesty felt like we paid several hundred pounds to do our own referencing.  Note KeySafe did not reply to my repeated attempts to discuss this with them, and the Financial Ombudsman lodged it as a cause for concern. I don’t know if you’re still using them, but if you are, I would recommend you consider whether they are providing just a service for yourselves to the detriment of tenant experience. \\r\\nLiving in the Cargo\\r\\nThe Good – Quiet, warm and well insulated with nice fittings and always clean in communal areas. The Gym is a nice facility, and the lounge looks inviting if a little quiet. The courtyard is well kept.\\r\\nAreas for development – The lift in building 2 on the left was broken for a significant period of time, often with little apparent haste to get it repaired. Once it was working, it then broke again shortly after. Recent times have been better, but I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say 6 weeks of no lift was a little more than inconvenient. \\r\\nA little niggle, but one none-the-less, the post-boxes are in the wrong entrance i.e. ours was in the right-hand side set, when we live in the left hand set. Such a simple thing to rectify and would make a difference to lots of tenants. \\r\\nThe smell on level -1 in the left lift in building 2. Despite this being reported multiple times, a strong smell still lingers there, more so than in other areas. Clearly a bin accident has occurred, but it hasn’t felt like a priority to fix it.\\r\\nCargo Staff and Reception\\r\\nThe Good – All the reception and concierge team are friendly, polite and professional and have a good relationship with residents. Parcels are taken and noted down which is really helpful and they always offer to pass on messages promptly. \\r\\nThe Not so good – I wrote to you regarding the issues with meter reads, and you were appropriate in responding to those issues with a reasonable plan for this. Unfortunately, of the following 4 times I have asked for meter reads, only 2 have arrived within the agreed time frame, once it was forgotten, and once I had to chase it via the management. Perhaps an alternative solution might a resident’s online portal where you can Ask for Meter Reads with a log of the time of the request and the time it was provided, Get notified when a Parcel Arrives, and Submit Questions to the concierge team? It wouldn’t be technically difficult but would provide a useful means of corresponding\\r\\nThe Renewal Process\\r\\nThe renewal process, as you are a commercial organisation, I was suppose always going to lead to an increase in rent, however I remain of the opinion that residents have not really had any quantifiable increase in value since the increase. The adaptations to the gym offers a reasonable added space, however at the cost cumulatively to the building’s residents I’m not sure it justifies the £1.92/resident/week increase. Nevertheless, one has to put a price on convenience of staying, and once the niggles of the previous 12 months were ironed out, the process moved on.\\r\\nI would note once again the signing of documents, adjusted rent calculations and general speed of this process was not overly-impressive, requiring me to proactively chase the team to ask where things were up to, carrying on living in the apartment without a new contract for a significant time period, which puts both your organisation and ourselves in difficult legal situation. However, once the time came, and after my writing to you about the meter reads, a calculation of rent was provided promptly.\\r\\nThe Tone of Communications\\r\\nThe Good - The Cargo offers many communications to residents over the year, from seasonal events like the Pumpkin carving, to updates about parcels now and then. Generally the emails and tone from the Reception guys is friendly and amicable. These events and activities are nice opportunities for residents to get to know each other and I’ve met a number of residents through these. The reception team are always friendly and helpful when you need them. Again, we appreciated this. \\r\\nAreas of development – I am again remembering that you are, inevitably, a commercial organisation first, and resident support team second, who need to ensure that rents are paid, income is maintained and revenue maximised. Recently, I feel that there’s been a slight culture change in the tone of your emails:\\r\\n-\\tAnyone not holding a valid car parking permit will have access restricted\\r\\n-\\tWill be asked to pay retrospective charges\\r\\n-\\tAny residents leaving trays in the corridor will be charged\\r\\nI also walked past a car with a note on the windscreen highlighting “illegal parking” parked on the front courtyard. I appreciate this must be an issue for you since the barriers have to be down now, however I would be careful about using the term “illegal parking” as, if anything, it would be a civil offence, and even then, until you acquire either both a BPA and IPC license, you would not be in a position to enforce this.\\r\\nI appreciate your requests in all these area stem from genuine issues, be it car parking issues, Tesco trolleys in the corridor, or rubbish in the lifts, however the tone, as a resident, is that of “do as we say or you will be financially penalised”. We all know that re-enforcement does not work nearly as well positive. Furthermore, in any well-functioning organisation, issues like this are seen as opportunities to learn, so for example one might just fine a motorist, or they might ask why is that person parking there, is it because they can’t get access to the car park, are they a visitor who you have clarified are not allowed to park, or is there another reason. Rather than resorting to charging your residents, perhaps try and think more about why these issues occur, and try to mitigate these reasons.\\r\\nMoving Out\\r\\nAgain, you are a commercial organisation, and your interests, at the end of the day, are to protect the Landlord’s investment. To that end, it came as no surprise that you levied inappropriate charge. At the commencement of our tenancy, you advised that if we used Terry to put up decorations, that this would not involve a charge, however, predictably you reneged on this at the end of the tenancy, and charged a “nominal” amount for this. As promised, this will be communicated on public platforms for other tenants to see. \\r\\nFinal Comments\\r\\nLiving in a new flat, with a great view and location has been amazing, and for city centre living, the Cargo genuinely offers a premium option. Day to day cargo residence is convenient and pain-free, with most issues quickly resolved by friendly and approachable staff. I would recommend living here to anyone. \\r\\nI would implore all those who take out tenancies to take lots of photos when they move in, get any verbal commitments agreed in writing and ensure that concerns are escalated early. \\r\\nThank you for an enjoyable tenancy, and I wish you all the best for the future.',\n",

As immigrants we were unaware of the house prices and we were really upset when we discovered the overpriced flat, mold, and heating issues. \\n\\r\\nWhat was even more frustrating was the blatant disregard for these basic maintaince issues and the overcharge monthly rates.  \\n\\r\\nDespite being a good tenant, respectful until the very end we still didn\\\\'t receive our full deposit back (which btw was one full months rent).  This whole experience was frustrating.

Landlord was usually helpful for minor repairs, but had a tendency to enter the property randomly without asking in order to access the roof of his cafe. He was amicable, except when pressed on water/mouse issues. No contact was ever made with managing agents (Black Katz) after signing the contract. Deposit returned smoothly.

After 3 years of living in, carpet is falling apart, tiles in a bathroom coming off the wall, walls between houses are so thin that we can hear when our neighbours sneezing. On a top of this we had to accept the fact that landlord is a part of our every day life. He is contacting us almost on a daily basis, for example when he thinks grass wasn\\\\'t cut by his standards. During his annual check he instructed us how to use cabinets in a kitchen haha. If you can stay away from this estate. He own houses from 34 to 52 turner avenue.\",\n",

I noticed it during my first night there and emailed the agency straight away. Unfortunately, I paid 6 months in advance (as I am self-employed and it seemed easier that way.. I guess, lessons learned). \\n\\r\\nThe agency and the landlord were very uncompromising. I was surprised at how little sympathy I had from them. I have emailed them asking to release me from the contract or to call an engineer to look for a solution, but had very little help. My GP sent them a letter saying that the vibrations were causing my headaches, but still no response. I installed the app that was measuring the vibrations and sent the results to the agency, but unfortunately, they ignored it. The engineer\\\\'s fee was over a thousand pounds which I was happy to pay but they needed to lift the carpets and the agency/landlord didn\\\\'t allow it.  \\n\\r\\nThey arranged a few viewings (after 4 months of weekly correspondence with them) and kept saying that they are being very generous to me. However, nothing ever came out of those viewings. Only after 6 months when I left, they waited for a month (so that they could use my deposit) and then found new tenants. \\n\\r\\nThe agency is called - Mountgrange heritage Kensington branch. \\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is nice and the bedroom is facing private gardens. Unfortunately, the flat needs work to address this issue. I hope this review saves someone from the situation I was in with this flat.\\n\\r\\nP.S. On top of that, there were also mice in the flat.

       "  'comment_body': \"We rented this property last year while expecting our second child. Initially the landlord and the agents at CKD were very enthusiastic, showing us the property, showing us the heating system and how the landlord had designed the whole house himself. \\n\\r\\nWe snapped up the property as its beautiful. Once we moved in we realised things were not going to be very good for us. For starters, the heating system in the property is not adiquate for the size of the property so unless we used convector heaters the house never got higher than 18 Degrees. Then our dishwasher broke. Rather than having an expert come and fit it the landlord Peter Shepheard asked if I would help him fit it so that he could save costs. We spent nearly an entire day trying to fit a dishwasher. We eventually did it with a dodgy fitted door. But anyway - it worked so yay!\\n\\r\\nThe landlord would pop round the property a few times a week without notice to inspect the garden, he beloved apple tree hes growing (which we were told not to touch  as he would deal with it - in our home!). On multiple occassions he let himself into the property while my partner was home with our children. Totally unacceptable behaviour.\\n\\r\\nThe garage door was poorly fitted on build and we noticed it was getting to a point it may fall from the garage roof. As I was parking my new Mercedes in the garage I was very concerned about this so asked the landlord to have it fixed. Guess what? Thats right - no professional, just Peter, A Drill and some screws. The results were loads of screws drilled into the garage roof to support the door. A very untidy and unprofessional job and I was not happy parking my car in the garage any longer.\\n\\r\\nWe gave our notice to the property sighting issues with broadband (yes its terrible) and the landlord tried his very best to make us stay - even by withholding a reference for 2 weeks!. As soon as we did take on a new property Peter\\\\'s attitude changed. He became very needy by email - writing to me sometimes 5 times per day demanding access to the property. He also emailed us multiple times a day demanding we surrender the lease early as he has a new renter lined up. \\n\\r\\nIn the end I had to issue him with a demand to stop contacting me or face Criminal Harassment charges. He backed off and never spoke to us again.\\n\\r\\nMy advice? Stay well away from this property unless your happy with a meddling old man popping round to make sure your looking after his show home. There are nicer and more efficient properties available for that sort of money.\",\n",

Clearly had been painted over before I moved in. Immediately became a problem and did have a massive impact on my children\\\\'s health. I always had windows open, heating on. Didn\\\\'t dry clothes on radiators etc yet black mould spread everywhere no Matter how much I cleaned it. Landlord stuck a de humidifier in for a few days, it did nothing. He then blamed it on me having furniture that was by the walls. (Where else does it go?) my clothes were ruined as the In built wardrobe was the worst spot. There\\\\'s an ongoing issue with foxes in the garden that makes it difficult for the kids to play out safely. Ants infest the kitchen all summer long. Bathroom is downstairs and was falling apart although I think they may have upgraded it since it\\\\'s been empty.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'As much as I enjoyed my room, the whole experience with the letting agency (G&Q Residential) was terrible. Any concern was never properly dealt with, and at times, was laughed away. We wanted a lock fitted to the front door to enable us to get insurance, however, the agency laughed at us telling us a lock is not needed in London!!! Needless to say the lock was never installed and we were constantly told \\\\\"we will ask the landlord\\\\\".\\n\\r\\nI was never inducted into the property and things were not explained properly. I was only told by my housemate that we couldn\\\\\\'t use the dishwasher (as I was never told) and then I was only told about hidden storage options 3 weeks before moving out (after 8/9 months in the property). This came after numerous disputes regarding storage. \\n\\r\\nIt took 6/7 months to finally get a key for the front door. For those months we had to go in through the back door by the communal bins.\\n\\r\\nEven though a weekly cleaner was included in the rental cost, we saw no evidence of a cleaner doing any sort of cleaning job. When we mentioned this to them, they would always say \\\\\"its a courtesy\\\\\". Therefore, the communal areas would get dirtier and then we would be told to keep the place clean\\n\\r\\nFinally, on many, many occasions, we would return home from work and find that the agency had been in the flat and moved everything round in the kitchen. When we asked why, they would only say \\\\\"its a communal area, you sign for the room\\\\\". However, as it is communal, we had all been okay with how the kitchen had looked.\\n\\r\\nI would severely recommend not signing with this agency. For the whole tenancy, we were lied to and had false promises made constantly.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The property had a great view and you can see London Eye and Shard! But BE AWARE the property has condensation in its severest form, the built in wardrobe is along the external wall and in winter the water makes it way through, leaving all clothes wet. Thick black mould forms everywhere, particularly severe in small bedroom. When i was checking out i moved my daughters bed to realise that my daughter was sleeping in the company of thick black mould for months and we did not know as it was hidden by the bed. \\n\\r\\nIn summer carpet moths will make an entry there were hundreds of them and in the night they fly - you find them even on your bed.\\n\\r\\nLandlady does not want to spend any money. She only has a half handyman who tries to fix things temporarily. Kenwood guys proposed her a permanent solution for condensation but she did not want to spend the money - it costed about £2k.\\n\\r\\nSo if you can manage to live in a property with mould and moths - i.e. use bleach and clean mould every day, use dehumidifiers (2-3 of them, one provided by landlady), use moth sprays and moth remedies, go for this flat.\\n\\r\\nMy Recommendation AVOID!',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The Landlords of this property have a history of trying to sell property in between long term contract and failed to sell for several years. They end contract before official end date to get new tenants at higher price every year so its not a stable home environment for any family wanting to rent this property as the long term contract is never fulfilled however I was there for over a year but given section 21 and told it was sold but now seen it’s on rent again after moving out for more than double the rent I paid. Most importantly the property was left in better condition than when moving in and maintained well and the checking out reports from estate agents provided this information but the landlords delay and demand damages even when advised not to by the agents making a fuss for things the agent says is unreasonable so I have to claim from TDS . Landlord thinks they can make extra money from tenants deposits and increase rent exceptionally high by moving tenants every year when there was a 3 year contract.  I am not the first to experience this when I did my research on this property. If you are a family wanting security then there is a game played by landlords not considering the tenants at all especially wanting deposit monies when deemed unreasonable even by Chancellors the estate agents who try to sell or rent consistently for years now.  Just be aware if you want honesty and landlords with integrity then you will not find that with this property and I don’t want another family to go through what I did.  The neighbours either side of the house are nice but the street has a few incidents of antisocial behaviour to the point that police have turned up opposite the house on many occasions.',\n",

Only thin chipboard as partition wall. No sound proofing whatsoever.

Also, not all keys provided for windows, so can\\\\'t open them all.\\r\\n- generally poor standard - \\\\'newly fitted\\\\' carpets are all loose and badly fitted. They pull out from the thresholds when you push the hoover over them.\\r\\n- side door is unusable, due to the terrible attempt at brickwork that should be toothed into the house. Will fall down at some point.\\r\\n- Cavities exposed where pipework has been run out, no attempts made to fill around pipes.\\r\\n- external doors very poorly fitting.\\r\\n- third bedroom won\\\\'t fit a full size single bed in it, so certainly not a 3 bed house.\\r\\n- Landlord has no interest in fixing issues - reported leaks and maintenance tickets were cancelled. Radiator still leaking when we left. Reported poorly fitting door/lock, were told it\\\\'s just the weather. Except we couldn\\\\'t get out of the property, as the lock was jammed shut. After a lot of trying, the handle pulled off the door and we had to fix this ourselves. The cheek to then be told after leaving that the back door lock is sticking and doesn\\\\'t lock - we\\\\'ve mentioned this numerous times on inspections and nothing was done. The same goes with the cistern in the bathroom. It came away from the wall within a week of being in the property. Due to poor fitment, it had been pushed back and secured to the wall with grab adhesive, which then pulled the plaster off. We fixed this ourselves too. The shower over the bath stopped working after someone \\\\'fixed\\\\' the hot tap that fell off. Never rectified. \\r\\n- none of the kitchen lower unit doors close properly, without physically pushing them all the way home.\\n\\r\\nIt\\\\'s a real shame, because the property could be so much better, and would make a fantastic home with some investment from the landlord. Unfortunately, despite being clear of most COVID rules, we were unable to physically view the property prior to moving in, rather, were sent a video walkround. Had we had chance to physically view, we\\\\'d likely never have taken the tenancy and gone elsewhere.\",\n",

Since the property is somewhat more elevated than the surrounding buildings, the kitchen and the main bedroom have a very pleasant view over the gardens of neighbouring houses.\\r\\nThe landlady is extremely friendly and accommodating. We have had some minor issues with leaks from the apartment above, and with the boiler, but they were settled immediately.\\r\\nThe only nuisance is the garbage area at the back of the house, which most often is a big mess (the house is divides in 6 apartments). \\r\\nThe area is very family friendly. Several good schools in walking distance. Our son attended Ashmount primary school and Highgate Wood secondary school.\\r\\nThe nearby Parkland walk is extremely convenient for running, strolling, or walking the dog.\\r\\nAlso nearby shops, nice restaurants and pubs, Elthorne Park (with great football pitch), and a GP.\\r\\n15 min walk (or 5 min bus ride) to Finsbury Park (Victoria and Picadilly lines) and to Archway (Northern line).',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'Property is close to brims down Station, trains leave every 30 mind, takes 25 mins to Liverpool Street. Bus stop is around the corner, shops and services 5-10 mins walk. Traffic usually busy during rush hours. Parking is usually hard to find, staff working in the area uses it usually, sometimes takes 10-15mins walk to park it. Because house is managed via housing association takes longer than usual to get an appointment to fix an issue, house is old and roof needs fixing. Is listed as 3 bedroom property, while 3rd room is a box and walls in mould. Suit has a shower an a toilet, but there is no way to use both bathrooms at the same time, and no water pressure in main shower, only hottest shower available. Boiler is very old, but gas fixing company is very fast and responsible. Neighbourhood is not very safe, road is very busy and windows are old, no noise isolation, there is a hospital near by, you can here them sometimes all night. A lot of noise from the street as well, neighbours fighting and smoking weed.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"Beware - there are serious problems with boilers in Arthur Court. At the time I moved out it didn\\\\'t look like it was going to be fixed and it had been the case for more than 5 years. There are several boilers in the common areas of the building that are supposed to supply all the flats with heating and hot water, and all of the boilers are past serviceable life. \\r\\nI lived in the flat from September 2017 till April 2018. In the first four months (September-December 2017) I didn\\\\'t have hot water for approximately one week out of every month, and no heating at all for most of that period because of the problems with boilers. This included the Christmas holiday. On 13 January heating was completely switched off in all the flats to prioritise hot water, and had not been restored by the time I moved out in April. Windows in the building are single-glazed, so it was freezing cold. Problems with hot water persisted. The building management sent a letter saying they would present a plan on how to raise funds to fix the boilers by the end of Q1 2018 which wasn\\\\'t done at the time I moved out (end of April 2018).\\r\\nOn top of constant boiler issues my flat was also broken into despite this being a portered block with CCTV. A known criminal (based on CCTV footage) broke the entire lock mechanism off of the door while I was at work (see photos below). \\r\\nI contacted my landlord and Westminster Council regarding the boiler issues, but I was told nothing could be done to fix this situation as Arthur Court is a freehold agreement, and some of the owners didn\\\\'t want to pay for boiler replacement.\\r\\nI strongly discourage you from moving into Arthur court as the quality of housing is incredibly low.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"The landlords (a couple) seems very sympathetic except, they have failed to make clear they are using the garage just below the living space of the tenant. The building is made of wood and the noise of the car they constantly put in, take out to clean is excruciating. The garage is constantly being opened. The noise of the garage door seems like a chain from the Tower of London. Listen to that several times in the day, specially now, working from home, and you will soon become insane. \\n\\r\\nAnother thing they failed to mention was that the landlord would be working full-time under the place where you live. He does a lot of wood work and fixing so you can hear wood being cut very, very loudly. He will deny it despite, you have seen him by going outside.\\n\\r\\nSince he can be under your floor from 7:30 to 22:30 to 23:00 in the night, including weekends, forget about privacy and quiet enjoyment of your home. \\n\\r\\nYou also don’t have any recycling bins. You are supposed to use their recycling bins which... are always full. One day after I approached the landlord to get a place to put my kitchen waste he got me a composter. That was really nice but when I returned from a day out he took the composter out without consulting me and, then in a very casual way, told me to clean the massive pile of rotten food that was inside the compost bin. I had to ask for a shovel so I didn\\\\'t have to buy one. The reason? He said he had an infection of rats which is fair enough but, he was the one who put the bin next to my house when, he has a massive land in the back where the bin could have been allocated. And I had to clean that too.\\n\\r\\nThe landlord manages your Mail. So expect your letters to be opened once and awhile, by mistake or not, I am not sure. \\n\\r\\nWhen I approached the landlord he doesn’t acknowledge anything and escalates things. Walk away. It’s a bit intimidating.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'I absolutely cannot recommend Flat 6 Ashley Villa enough. My wife and I have just bought our first new build property, but we had a very good time living in Flat 6. Reasons it is so good include:\\n\\r\\n1. Location is absolutely amazing, close to the Chelsea Road shops, on the main route for the X39, A4 bus, close to Bristol-Bath bike path and Two Tunnels route; Lidl, M&S, Argos, etc; 20 minute walk to the city centre of Bath. Newbridge area is lovely; I already miss it.\\n\\r\\n2. Really nicely done out flat; the kitchen is incredible; bathrooms are really well fitted too, modern and in excellent condition.\\n\\r\\n3. Long nature of the Flat, mostly South facing, means you get the sun shining in through various windows and the flat stays warm and has just a really nice positive feeling to it. We hardly paid anything for bills (about £300 refund from Octopus energy) - you don\\\\\\'t even need to turn the heating on in winter if the sun is shining. Really well insulated.\\n\\r\\n4. Two decent sized bedrooms and two bathrooms, including one with a bath which is just amazing. Ashley did a really good job of fitting these.\\n\\r\\n5. Nice entry way and nicely done out garden space and shedding at the back (bike store).\\n\\r\\n6. Your own parking space included, right outside the house, without any stressful parallel parks, just no price to put on that.\\n\\r\\n7. Ashley is an exceptional landlord, a very nice person and always there to answer questions and sort out snags (although honestly there weren\\\\\\'t very many snags).\\n\\r\\nSome relatively minor drawbacks:\\n\\r\\n1. The flat is so well insulated that it does not cool down very much in summer. You will need to invest in a water cooler/ portable air conditioning to be able to sleep.\\n\\r\\n2. The main road is very noisy if you open the windows (which had to happen in summer months). With the windows closed you can still hear the road, but you get used to it very quickly (and some people like the \\\\\"buzz\\\\\" / energy of that). When I was working at home in summer I had to close the windows to hear my videocalls, which made it very hot.\\n\\r\\n3. Fridge and freezer are relatively small for a 2 bed flat; it\\\\\\'s the only thing that\\\\\\'s missing in the kitchen. All the other storage spaces are more than enough; arguably better than our new build kitchen.\\n\\r\\nDespite the last three minor issues I would give this a 10/10 and would definitely like to still live in the flat if we weren\\\\\\'t trying to get on the property ladder. You won\\\\\\'t find a better place like this in Bath in my opinion (and I\\\\\\'ve looked to comparable places/prices - they are a joke). You won\\\\\\'t regret choosing here, and personally, I\\\\\\'d much prefer to pay a private landlord than line the pockets of the letting agents.',\n",

There was a range of other slightly less serious issues. \\n\\r\\nAfter constant pressure from me to sort out the most serious issue (gas safety), they sent two different gas engineers. Both concluded that various gas appliances were unsafe. As this and other issues were not resolved promptly, I had to involve the Council.

I asked for a couple of months so my daughter could finish her school year but the landlord was adamant and even took me to court as retaliation. He intended to keep a substantial percentage of my deposit - we even had to go to arbitration.

       "  'comment_body': 'The landlord (Ross Everitt) was exceptionally rude, dismissive & inattentive to any needs on our behalf being myself, my fiancee & 5 children. He continually swerved & avoided completing any jobs that were agreed with him prior to moving in & would often contact myself making absurd requests to fix & change things in the house that were not my responsibility. He seemed to be under the impression that i would be foolish enough to carry out his instructions if he tried to bully me enough. I could add numerous email correspondence to this review that would leave you gobsmacked at the pure cheek of the guy. In the end, i had to threaten legal action to get him to leave us alone after we vacated the property, as he had left himself open to legal action due to not placing all of the £3000 security deposit i had paid to him into the TDS protection scheme. He finally stopped contacting me after legal proceeding were mentioned to him along with the name & address of the solicitors who were going to be taking the case up for me.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The only benefit of this property is the location, being situated very close to various universities and amenities, and the security guard was extremely friendly and helpful - however, this is where the pros end. The walls are so thin that it is possible to hear conversations in a room three doors down the hallway in one flat. The communal kitchen is disgusting, with only the bare essentials. If the lights and the hob are switched on at the same time in the kitchen, the whole flat will fuse, and it is extremely difficult to get the power back on, especially since X1 do not seem to care or want to help their tenants at all. The plug in the kitchen sink was blocked and smelled disgusting, and the washing machine left clothes steaming for hours afterwards and so hot to the touch that it was worrying. Flooring inside my room was breaking and curving upwards at the edges, and the bathroom looked closer to a prison than a flat which has the rent stability of a yoyo. Reported several issues to maintenance, who did nothing to fix anything - as a result, I am now at risk of losing my deposit because maintenance did not fix anything which was reported whilst I was a tenant. Slats holding the bed up snapped as soon as I sat on the mattress, and I was threatened several times by another tenant, to the point that I felt unsafe in my own flat.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"This is a review for one of the studios in this property. It is call Flat 2. The main issue is that it is 15 sq. m. including the shower room. (Approximately 150 sq. f.) So it is quite expensive if you look at the price for the area you get. Now I\\\\'ll try to describe it by zones in different paragraphs after talking about admin matters.\\n\\r\\nYou will probably have to rent it paying an state agent but later it is the Landlord who deal with the fixing. At least it was like this when we where there. He didn\\\\'t turn up to sign the contract and a lady from the state agent did it. Later we could find our that the contract wasn\\\\'t that relevant apparently. The deposit was property protected and it took us around 3 weeks to get it after chasing the landlord. Electricity and waters bills are included in the rent. You will have to pay the council tax that it was nearly £1,000 a year.\\n\\r\\nOut site the building looks and was just a house. Each room has been transformed into an studio so at some point, including the people renting the garden flat, there where around 15 souls living in this place. Whole families are living in these very small studios. Nearly no one recycle property so bins are usually a mess at the front of the house. There is no proper box mail for each flat so letters just arrive for all tenants mixed through the door. There is no proper ring-bells for each flat either. In the entrance you can find an unventilated hall where the boiler tint the walls in black dust. The shared washing machine is also there and it can take up 3 weeks to get fixed (the new one was performing some better though) Generally speaking the shared areas are in bad conditions and this was aggravated by a 2 calendar year construction site next door that was still going on the day we left. Builders were allow to use our shared outside area. This made things really unpleasant. \\n\\r\\nInside, the studio is small. It is basic and quite functional too. The sink does a lot of noise every time the persons upstairs open their tap. And eventually also get blocked and then the landlord send somebody to unblock it. The noise problems don\\\\'t go. We manage to make it OK by using the plug and putting a weight on it. Heating performs nicely. The shower tray is 70 by 70 cm. \\n\\r\\nWe quite enjoyed the garden by having a shed, having our bikes there and planting strawberries and chives.\",\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The landlord does not care about the living standards of the tenant at this property. Single glazed throughout, with no central heating just electric conduction heaters, we only heated the living room in the winter, and that cost us £30+ a week alone. The high street serves over 10 major bus routes and at least 2 that run 24 hours a day, sleep is at a premium if you live here. The adjoining property is also owned by the same landlord and consists of the same poor standards, in this instance the landlord is taking advantage of the tenants also, knowing that they have nowhere else to go. We made is as best a family home as we could for the 3 years but as soon as we could, we moved. On one occasion I answered the door at 10pm to a man standing with a knife in my face, it was one of the men living in the house next door. Another incident was when the shop below decided to turn the water supply off overnight. When I confronted him, he denied all knowledge, as I went back up to the property, as if magic, the supply was on again! The landlord was called over this, and visited straight away but could not see a problem. Thames Water were also useless as the supply comes through the shop. To summarise, I would avoid this property and landlord like the plague. Whilst the landlord is friendly to speak to, his interest is to trap a tenant in the property, knowing full well that they cannot afford to leave, and not spend a penny of investment or maintenance on the property. You would be better off sleeping in the car park across the road, which by the way, is the only parking space for miles, at £1,200 per year for a parking space. AVOID.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'We wanted to be able to call this our home for the long term - we’ve painted the whole place to remove the staining from when we came in and brought in several new bits of furniture to the ‘furnished’ property. The poor communication and unwillingness to fix issues of the landlord though makes it impossible. \\r\\nPaulette Lemonius likes to ignore problems, palms off fixing requests and when eventually gets someone in to do work they are handy men without the ability to get the job done well or quickly. Examples: The top apartment’s toilet leaked over our bathroom causing the roof to eventually rot away and fall on our heads while showering. It was over 6 months before anything was done when this issue was first raised and even then it took a number of very long appointments and three different handymen to sort it out. Dry rot has existed in our lounge room for over one year and despite frequent requests it was only dealt with three months ago and has since come back causing paint to bubble and discolor again. No handy man is yet to assist despite many requests with sorting it once and for all. Our most recent saga is that our front door lock has broken and while anyone else would get in a locksmith to sort it quickly her partner tried for 8 hours to sort it and left without the security lock functioning - it doesn’t snob security into the wall. \\r\\nA report was provided to the landlord over a year ago recommending the boiler be replaced which hasn’t happened, and the down lights which were fitted years ago by an unqualified electrician not to code and have caused charring on structural beams. Ms Lemonius was issued a notice requiring them to be changed and only 6 of the 24, or 2 rooms, are yet to be done so we’re potentially living in a fire hazard. Our bin is also broken with a missing lid but she won’t pay the £50 to replace it so foxes frequent our patio and make a mess. \\r\\nOur neighbours had some similar issues with the responsiveness of the landlord and quality of the flat and left not long ago. \\r\\nStreet parking is relatively easy and aside from Saturday nights the area is relatively quiet - unless you’re a light sleeper. The planes going overhead at all hours can be a little much. \\r\\nPeople don’t respect traffic signs and speed up and down the street...that coupled with the group of 20 young men who regularly hang at the top of the street smoking weed and doing drug deals, this probably isn’t the place for children. \\r\\nTraffic is always congested at Brixton and Clapham North junctions but the flat is close to both the Northern and Victoria tube lines as well as Clapham High St overground. \\r\\nPolice have notified us of breakins in the street twice in the last year but we’ve never felt unsafe walking around outside.',\n",

The curtains were damaged and was fixed six months after we settled in, the couches were removed after 8 months of persuading the landlord to get rid of the nastiness, and the boiler was replaced a year later of reporting it to them. \\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is quite, except the planes at night which do make a scene. All I can say is that the landlord will not respect your privacy, and the estate agent will help her invade your privacy.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': \"House was \\\\'ok\\\\' for the price (at £1480pm) London expensive and low quality standards, furniture included with the house was of the cheapest IKEA quality as is the will of adding or changing things. Any time something broke, the Landlord was always understanding and he tried to fix everything manually himself and i consider him one of the great landlords i have come to know, BUT the agency drives him and the price house as much as possible, asking (sneakily) for rent increases at every possible occasion.\\n\\r\\nWe moved out mainly because they tried to raise the rent by £170 per month (from £1480 to £1650) in a time (last year) when the market was a buyer\\\\'s market. When people from Europe is running back to their countries, leaving many flats empty and prices dropping.\\n\\r\\nObviously, they could not manage to get their asking price, so it was rented at £1600 instead and the only way they managed that is by squeezing a 3rd person (in a 2 bedroom house..., probably living in the living room) in, so it looks like a good deal...\\n\\r\\nIn short, old and bad quality furniture, some carpeting was torn and never fixed, we had bed bugs every now and then that we did not introduce (Was there from the beginning) and the lack of trust towards the future on pricing, as well as the attitude towards getting more money out of it from the agents who have never visited the flat (how ironic - pricing something without looking at it) would make me say AVOID.\\n\\r\\nThe entrance is through the back, as the house is on the high street, meaning there is a security door and a loooong corridor before you reach the entrance, meaning that when you are moving in or out or coming in or out from shopping you have a lot of walk and stairs before you are in. Even worse, the corridor to the entrance is always full of long left rotting garbage, flies, fast food left overs, beer bottles and cans and all that because the shops in the front of the house have the code, which they then distribute to their staff to lock their bikes etc.\\n\\r\\nThe security door in question was broken and the landlord did not care to fix it or talk to the other people sharing it to fix it, it was only down to the kindness of one of the businesses to fix it.\",\n",

When we moved in, the drainage in the kitchen was unacceptable - water from the washing machine would back up into the kitchen sink, and any water in the kitchen sink could take over half an hour to drain, and this problem took over 4 weeks to repair.  The hob only had two of four rings working and the ignition switch was broken, contravening gas safety standards.  It took several weeks for the landlord to measure for a replacement, and then several more weeks passed before the hob was delivered, and then several more before the repair occurred. The gas safety certificate later expired and we had to prompt the landlord to renew.  We had to have pest control investigations for mice infestation in our property and the downstairs flat, on two separate occasions.\\n\\r\\nFinally, at the end of the tenancy, we were threatened with a deduction from our rent because the landlord claimed that the property was \\\\\"too untidy\\\\\" during viewings for prospective new tenants and that we had been warned about this, when no such warning was issued.  This was never acted upon and the deposit was returned in full, but we later discovered that the deposit had never been protected by the landlord as required by law.',\n",

       "  'comment_body': 'The woman who owns the house was a complete nightmare, she would never try to fix things that were her fault - instead simply she would not respond to messages for months at a time, was rude and disrespectful, did not even attempt to help us in any way. She literally tried to charge us £1700 for the most frivolous, completely made up reasons. For example we never smoked inside the property and she claimed she paid £250 pounds to get rid of the smoke smell, she claimed we owed heating bills of £480 even after we showed her proof that we paid every single bill on time, she said we ruined the floors even though we were extremely careful and even took our shoes off every single time we went into the flat, she charged us £150 for replacing a clip-on oven gasket made of plastic that cost £20 online, amongst a myriad of easily disproven, completely ridiculous claims. Thankfully the good people at the Tenancy Deposit Scheme took our side and she ended up only getting £300 from us. She used the six month break clause on us by sending some shady person to slip a letter under our door at 9am on a Monday - giving us a section 21 notice without telling us the reason why. After a week she finally responded to us and simply said the housing market prices in the area had gone up and wanted to get an extra £850 a month for the flat, effectively kicking us out IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. All in all this lady is clearly trying to make hardworking young professionals pay her mortgage  for her and give her a free home makeover. Absolutely despicable human being - do not rent this flat ever.',\n",
